Dunn is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer, revealed to be estranged from his daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses as he doesn\\'t train women and she\\'s too old to begin a boxing career. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Frankie\\'s friend and employee — and the film\\'s narrator — encourages and helps Maggie.\\n',\n",

       " 'Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mickey Mack but, out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, Mo Chuisle (misspelled in the film as \"mo cuishle\"), but doesn\\'t tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\\n',\n",
       " 'Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas against the WBA women\\'s welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic.\\n',\n",
       " \"While in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family. They arrive only after first touring Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood, and accompanied by an attorney; their sole concern is to get Maggie's assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their welfare fraud if they try to contact her again.\\n\",\n",

Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to drown in her own blood. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie's priest warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's request.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Frankie then sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he tells Maggie the meaning of \"mo cuishle\", \"my darling, and my blood\". He never returns to the gym. Scrap\\'s narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie\\'s daughter, informing her of her father\\'s true character.\\n']"
