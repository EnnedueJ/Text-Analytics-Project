       " 'The Champion (1915 film)': 'In this comedy, Charlie Chaplin has a companion—a pet bulldog.  Walking along a street with his bulldog, Charlie finds a \"good luck\" horseshoe just as he passes the training camp of an enormous fighter named Spike Dugan.  Outside the camp is a large, painted advertisement which states Dugan is seeking sparring partners \"who can take a punch.\" After watching other better fighters be soundly beaten by Dugan, Charlie decides his best bet is to put the horseshoe inside his boxing glove.  Using the loaded glove, Charlie connects with a solid punch and wins. The trainer prepares Charlie to fight the world champion. A gambler wants Charlie to throw the fight. He and the trainer\\'s daughter fall in love.',\n",
       " 'Horse Feathers': 'The film revolves around college football and a game between the fictional Darwin and Huxley Colleges.[a] Many of the jokes about the amateur status of collegiate football players and how eligibility rules are stretched by collegiate athletic departments remain remarkably current.[5] Groucho Marx portrays Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, the new president of Huxley College, while Zeppo Marx plays his son Frank, a student at the school who convinces his father to recruit professional football players to help Huxley\\'s losing football team. There are also many references to Prohibition. Baravelli, played by Chico Marx, is an \"iceman\", who delivers ice and bootleg liquor from a local speakeasy. Pinky, played by Harpo Marx, is also an \"iceman\", and a part-time dogcatcher. Through a series of misunderstandings, Baravelli and Pinky are accidentally recruited to play for Huxley instead of the actual professional players. This requires them to enroll as students, which creates chaos throughout the school.The climax of the film, which ESPN listed as first in its \"top 11 scenes in football movie history,\"[6] includes the four protagonists winning the football game by successfully performing a version of the hidden ball trick and then scoring the winning touchdown in a horse-drawn garbage wagon that Pinky rides like a chariot. A picture of the brothers in the \"chariot\" near the end of the film made the cover of Time magazine in 1932.[7]',\n",
       " 'Raging Bull': 'In 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta, practices a comedy routine.In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he suffered his first loss. Jake\\'s brother, Joey LaMotta, discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts. Some time thereafter, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the Army the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie.Jake constantly worries about Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake\\'s opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.A year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joey\\'s house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of Joey\\'s wife Lenora and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake\\'s career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.By 1956, Jake and his family have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been planning since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon Joey, who forgives him but is elusive.Again in 1964, Jake now recites the \"I coulda been a contender\" scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront, where Terry Malloy complains that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant \"I\\'m the boss\" while shadowboxing.',\n",

When her family arrives home, they find paramedics and police gathered outside, as Stacy is rushed to the hospital, where she dies.In a flashback to ten months earlier, Angela Delvecchio (Kellie Martin) is a shy high school sophomore who aspires to be popular, beautiful and perfect in everything. She performs well academically in school, attends Mass regularly, and sets high goals for herself. She idolizes Stacy, who is the most popular girl at school, as well as a cheerleader. One of the reasons why Angela admires Stacy is because one of Angela\\'s goals is to become a cheerleader. When Angela is accepted into the Larks, the school\\'s popular clique, she tries to forge a friendship with the rich, snobbish and conceited Stacy, who rejects her. She then further suffers being rejected for a coveted position as one of the yearbook staff and in an audition for the cheerleading squad, leaving her humiliated and feeling like a failure.The events of the night of Stacy\\'s stabbing are shown from Angela\\'s perspective. Still determined to be friends with Stacy, Angela calls Stacy\\'s mother and anonymously invites her to a party under the guise of there being a special dinner for the Larks. Once Stacy gets in the car with Angela, she reveals that the \"dinner\" story was a lie she told Stacy\\'s mother so she would be allowed to meet Angela. Infuriated, Stacy demands to be taken home. Angela tries to explain how much she admires Stacy and wants to be like her, but the arrogant Stacy is less than sympathetic. Unmoved, she calls Angela \"pathetic\" and exits the car, stating that everyone in school will now laugh at Angela. Stacey then runs to a nearby house, where she asks to use the telephone, explaining that the \\'friend\\' she was with had \\'gotten a little weird\\', and manages to get a ride home. Angela follows the car back to Stacy\\'s home, and out of fear that Stacy will spread rumors about her, Angela stabs Stacy multiple times and leaves her for dead.Angela avoids capture in the weeks following the incident. Although Angela is interviewed by the police, she is not named as a suspect. Angela, along with all of the Larks, attends Stacy\\'s Funeral Mass. Most of the students put the blame for Stacy\\'s murder on one of their classmates, Monica Whitley (Kathryn Morris), a goth girl who was always mocked and tormented by Stacy for her appearance; she and Stacy always hated each other and she threatened to kill her. At first, no one suspects Angela because she is seemingly too nice to commit the crime. Furthermore, Jamie Hall (Marley Shelton), Angela\\'s former best friend and one of Stacy\\'s friends, tells Angela that she never really liked Stacy, and was only afraid of her.As her junior year begins, Angela becomes more involved with the community, taking up such activities as peer counseling and candy striping. Overwhelmed by Stacey\\'s murder, one of the Larks brings up the idea of disbanding. Determined not to let this happen, Angela argues that they should remain active, noting that the group was not only important to Stacy, but also to the various community activities in which they take part. This idea not only saves the Larks, but also wins Angela the position of secretary/treasurer.In the meantime, a harassment campaign is waged against Monica until she finally leaves the school. At this point, authorities resume their investigation and begin re-interviewing possible suspects, including Angela. With the authorities slowly closing in on her, she becomes more and more consumed by her guilt, until she finally confesses to her priest and then to her parents in a letter.Devastated by the arrest, Jamie, who had gone to St. Joseph\\'s Catholic School with Angela prior to high school, confesses to their priest to having left her in a ski lodge alone during a ski trip the year before, all because she did not have the courage to stand up to Stacy. The high school\\'s principal, Ed Saxe, declared Angela a \\'sick kid\\' and that there is no problem with materialism. As the trial begins, the Prosecutor argues that Angela should be charged with first-degree murder as there was evidence of premeditation. Angela\\'s lawyer claims it was second-degree murder.The judge agrees with the defense, after listening to Angela\\'s taped confession. Stating that, other than the tape, the rest of the evidence was just circumstantial and that the prosecution failed to prove the crime to be premeditated. Angela is then sentenced to confinement until the age of 25. Back at the church, the priest gives a homily on the community\\'s responsibility for the death of Stacey, stating that the unrealistic high expectations and pressures to be \"perfect\" contributed to Angela\\'s actions. As the movie ends, Jamie writes a letter to Angela, explaining that she quit the Larks (having left when she realized how mean they were to Angela) and that she plans to leave Santa Mira High School and go back to her former school, St. Joseph\\'s. Angela is released and paroled after a few years from juvenile hall.',\n",

Her life changes dramatically when her father loses his job, and the family must relocate to the disadvantaged city, Crenshaw Heights, which Britney, being the \"white girl\", takes quite a while to adjust to.She meets Camille, cheerleading captain of the Crenshaw Heights Warriors and her friends and fellow cheerleaders, Kirresha and Leti. She also meets Jesse, a male cheerleader and the only person who is nice to her on her first day. Britney, at the urging of Winnie, has already vowed to never cheer for another team (as this would make her a \"cheer whore\"), but after being dared by Camille and Jesse to show up at the cheerleading tryouts, Britney impresses everyone with her skills and experience. Camille, after being persuaded by her friends to \"do it for the squad\", reluctantly lets her in. Britney and Jesse become close and eventually kiss.Around this time, singer Rihanna announces a television special where all high school cheerleading squads can compete, with the winners appearing in a performance with her that will be shown worldwide and winning brand new computers for their school. Winnie finds out that Britney\\'s cheering with the Warriors and tells her friends. A week later, Britney lies to Camille, telling her that she cannot cheer at the next game because she will be holding a memorial service for her dead dog; when she is actually going to Pacific Vista\\'s Homecoming dance. Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney\\'s to offer their condolences, and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up for the dance, Camille kicks her off the squad.At the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad behind Britney\\'s back, causing Britney to break up with Brad and end her friendship with Winnie. She calls them a \"pig\" and \"too much of a backstabber to have any real friends\", respectively. On the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warriors\\' bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, mock and make racial jokes about the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again. Jesse, however, is still mad at her for not telling him that she had a boyfriend before they had kissed. Both of the rivaling teams show their performances. At the auditions, the two finalists are Pacific Vista and Crenshaw Heights. PV wows the audience with their routine and Camille starts getting worried. Then Britney points out that all their steps are repetitive and that they have their secret weapon: Krumping. Now dressed in streetwear instead of their regular uniforms, steps on stage during PV\\'s performance and begins mirroring their steps. Finally, they begin krumping, wiping PV off the stage and impressing Rihanna with their routine.  After the Warrior\\'s performance ends, Winnie approaches Rihanna and insists that Crenshaw Heights should be disqualified (\"or arrested\") for interrupting PV\\'s routine. This leads to an argument between Winnie and the rest of the Pacific Vista squad, during which Britney notes, \"Spirit Law states that if there\\'s a cheer mutiny, a squad can vote to replace their captain.\"Everyone present, even Rihanna and the other performing squads, vote to replace Winnie as the Pacific Vista High cheerleading captain. Winnie protests, dismissing CH\\'s style as \"ghetto\", to which Rihanna responds that she judges a squad by their skills and not by where they come from. Rihanna ultimately selects Crenshaw Heights as the winners, and the Pacific Vista squad with Britney\\'s friend Amber as their new captain comes forward to congratulate them. Britney and Jesse also make up, kissing backstage after their first performance. The film ends with a made-for-film music video of Rihanna\\'s \"Pon de Replay\" with the Crenshaw Heights squad dancing in the background. During the end credits, the main characters are seen dancing to the outro music as the film ends.',\n",

This proves to be the case when Alexis is thrown into the air and her teammates fail to catch her in time, resulting in her death. Once school resumes Mäddy decides that she will try out for the cheerleading team and manages to impress the entire team with her acrobatic skills.

       " 'Fire in Babylon': 'The documentary describes the ascension of West Indies cricket from being a team largely composed of highly talented, entertaining, \"Calypso Cricketers\" to a determined unit that dominated world cricket for nearly twenty years.It begins with an introduction to the West Indies Cricket Team. Using interviews with West Indian cricketing greats, and other people closely associated with West Indies cricket; the idea of culturally and politically different Caribbean nations playing under the common banner of the West Indies is described.The history of cricket in the West Indies is briefly described, such as the appointment of Sir Frank Worrell as the first black man to captain the West Indies Cricket Team, and the emergence of such cricketing greats as Everton Weekes, Learie Constantine, and Sir Garfield Sobers. However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as \"Calypso Cricketers\"; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose.The early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don\\'t have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd\\'s first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.Australians Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson destroyed the West Indies with their fast bowling. Frequent bouncers and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match test series 5–1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate fast bowlers as devastating as Lillee and Thomson.When the Indian Cricket Team toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Wayne Daniel to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling.Convinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd\\'s team departed to their Tour of England in 1976. England Captain Tony Greig\\'s infamous \"grovel\" comment is shown in its entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. Viv Richards is shown as dominating the Test series as a batsman, where he scored 829 runs in four tests with two double-centuries. Viv Richards\\' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.The documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how Kerry Packer eventually enticed the team to participate in World Series Cricket in 1977. World Series Cricket turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game.The 1982 Rebel Tour to Apartheid-ruled South Africa is described. Colin Croft chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the West Indies Cricket Board. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar Viv Richards. Richards states that he was offered \"a blank cheque\", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time.It ends with a description of the West Indies\\' tour to England in 1984. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After Gordon Greenidge\\'s innings of 214 not out at Lord\\'s, the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5–0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term \"Whitewash\" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed Blackwash.The documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, Michael Holding describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series. (it was preceded by the controversial West Indies tour of New Zealand in 1979–80)',\n",

His wife, Monobina Das (Mouni Roy), also supports and helps him realize his dreams. The training begins but there is a lack of teamwork between the players due to several conflicts.

Although India wins the semi-finals, it turns a hard match.In the finals, during the first half against Great Britain, Himmat is benched again,and Great Britain scores 2 goals.

The second part takes place after the dentist has extracted his broken teeth.Following a nightclub altercation, in which Frank takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and punches a couple of the others, he is recruited by the team\\'s manager, who sees profit in his aggressive streak.Although at first somewhat uncoordinated at the sport, he impresses the team\\'s owner, Gerald Weaver (Badel), with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial. He is signed up to the top team as a loose forward (number 13) and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposing players.Off the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond (Roberts), a mother of two young children, lost her husband in an accident at Weaver\\'s engineering firm but received no financial compensation, because the death was ruled a suicide. Margaret rebuffs Frank’s attempts to court her and treats him rudely and abrasively. Frank takes Margaret and her children out for the day and they play in the River Ure next to Jervaulx Abbey.

On his death-bed, the touch judge confesses to failing to disallow the winning try for an infringement by the Welsh scorer. The Welsh Rugby Union president announces that in order to set the record straight, there should be a rematch between the two teams - using the same players who had played the match 25 years earlier.[1]The teams are forced to re-assemble, each bringing along not only their 25 years of unfitness, but also various skeletons in the closet - most notably the major falling-out between two of Wales\\'s star players, Bleddyn Morgan and David Llewellyn, whose friendship had ended acrimoniously many years earlier. Morgan, had since moved to New Zealand, and initially refuses to play the match. It is later revealed that this is because of a love triangle which had developed between the two and Llewellyn\\'s fiancée Bronwen. He is persuaded to play, for the sake of his country, but there is considerable acrimony between the two players which threatens to disrupt the team\\'s performance.The film is a blend of drama and comedy - the latter especially revolving around the efforts of the players to come to grips with both their middle-aged bodies and the changes in rugby since their time as international players (rugby was a totally amateur sport in 1966; by 1991 it had become big business). The New Zealand team are a rag-tag bunch whose later lives have taken them in different directions: the team\\'s \"hard man\" has become a peace-loving Salvation Army officer, one of the team has become a vote-grabbing politician, yet another has become a homeless drunk. All are reassembled and put through their paces by their 1970s coach, \"Acid\" (a biting caricature by Martyn Sanderson of fabled All Blacks coach Fred Allen). The film culminates in the replayed game, played at Cardiff Arms Park.According to the Helen Martin and Sam Edwards\\' book New Zealand Film 1912 - 1996: \"The dialogue is witty and characterisations are fine, if deliberately overplayed, but the ending turns the film into a shaggy-dog story.\"[2] The match ball is replaced by Wales\\'s \"lucky ball\", an antique taken from the Welsh Rugby Museum by Price. With the scores tied, a shot is taken at goal, but the ancient leather of the ball is not strong enough and it deflates, landing limply on the crossbar where it remains.

He is sentenced to a boys' Juvenile Detention Center in Salt Lake City.[1] The manager of the center, Marcus (Sean Astin) puts him on the Highland rugby team much to his chagrin, coached by Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole). He struggles to adapt to this new team's ways. A friend sends him a rugby ball with drugs hidden in the stitching. He uses the drugs until, influenced by something one of his new teammates tells him, he throws the drugs away. He works hard and finds the strength to become a member of the widely admired Highland team. Each day when he arrives at team practice he criticizes the coach for sitting around chatting with different team members and not doing any real coaching. Then it is his turn to sit with the coach and finds himself confessing to the drugs hidden in the rugby ball. The coach deals with it and tells him that his teammates want him to be a coach. He is influenced by brotherhood and can cope with his homesickness.Driving home after a celebration meal, the team are helping a mother and two children with a flat tire when a passing car clips one of the boys. Rick now must deal with the death of his first true friend Kurt (Michael J. Pagan). Rick is released and returns to live with his parents. His father wants him to tell about the Highland team's moves and plays but Rick resists and they argue. His father makes it up by lending Rick the keys to his sports car, and Rick drives to meet up with Tammy and his old friends. They too become angry that Rick won't reveal the Highland team's secrets and a fight breaks out. They plant drugs and alcohol in the sports car and Rick is arrested when the police show up. Tammy tells the police what really happened and Rick is released. Rick finds himself again in the national championship, this time against the former friends on his old team coached by his estranged father. The game is hard fought. Players from his old team try to hurt Rick through cheap shots to collect the bounty on his head. Coach Penning tells Rick if he stays down Rick will end up like him. Rick gets back up and, in the final seconds, scores the winning try for Highland. As the film ends it is shown that in real life, under Coach Gelwix, Highland has been winning almost every year.\",\n",
       " 'Invictus (film)': 'On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail.[6] Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela\\'s predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.While attending a game between the Springboks, the country\\'s rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that some black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year\\'s time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with François a British poem, \"Invictus\", that had inspired him during his time in prison.François and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela\\'s efforts. Mandela\\'s security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades\\' professionalism and dedication.As Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their arch-rivals—Australia, the defending champions and known as the Wallabies—in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in Taiwan, defeat France in heavy rain to advance to the final against their other arch-rival: New Zealand, known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20–19–2) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.Meanwhile one day during the tournament, the Springbok team visited Robben Island, where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela\\'s will and his idea of self-mastery in \"Invictus\". François mentions his amazement that Mandela \"could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put him there\".Supported by a large home crowd of all races at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg, Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela\\'s security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a South African Airways Boeing 747-200 jetliner flies in low over the stadium. It is not an assassination attempt though, but a demonstration of patriotism, with the message \"Good Luck, Bokke\"—the Springboks\\' Afrikaans nickname—painted on the undersides of the plane\\'s wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar\\'s #6 jersey.The Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15–12 in extra time, thanks to a drop goal from fly-half Joel Stransky. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the William Webb Ellis Cup, as the Springboks are now indeed rugby union\\'s world champions. Mandela\\'s car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. He insists that there is no hurry as his security team wanted to change the route due to the cheering crowd. As Mandela watches South Africans celebrating together in the street from his car, his voice is heard reciting \"Invictus\" again.',\n",

After the war, Waldo had taken up barnstorming to make a living. He soon tangles with rival barnstormer (and fellow war veteran) Axel Olsson.Antagonistic at first, Waldo and Axel become partners and try out various stunts. One of these stunts, a car-to-aircraft transfer, goes wrong and Waldo is nearly killed after Axel is unable to climb high enough to clear a barn, slamming Waldo into it.  Waldo then goes home to Kansas to be with on-again, off-again girlfriend Maude and her family. Maude is not happy to see Waldo at first, as every time he returns from a barnstorming tour of the country, he is injured in some way. Eventually, they make up and become lovers once again. Meanwhile, Maude\\'s brother Ezra, a long-time friend of Waldo\\'s since boyhood, promises to build Waldo a high-performance monoplane as soon as he is well enough to fly it. Waldo\\'s goal is to become the first pilot in history to successfully perform an outside loop, and Ezra feels Waldo can do it with the monoplane.In the meantime, Waldo rejoins Axel. The two eventually get a job flying for a traveling flying circus owned by Doc Dillhoefer. However, Dillhoefer\\'s Flying Circus is in a slump, as there is very little attendance at the shows. In an effort to attract bigger crowds, Dillhoefer hires Mary Beth to act as the show\\'s new sexual attraction, in which she would climb out on the wing of an aircraft in flight wearing shredded clothes, thus allowing the wind to blow them off. But while performing this new stunt for the first time, Mary Beth freezes up on the wing, afraid to return to the cockpit. As Waldo (who did a \"plane-to-plane transfer\" in flight to climb aboard Mary Beth\\'s aircraft) extends his hand to help Mary Beth back into the cockpit, she slips and falls off the wing to her death. As a result of Mary Beth\\'s death, Waldo, Axel, and Dillhoefer are temporarily grounded by an inspector of the newly formed Air Commerce division of the federal government, Newt Potts, a man from Waldo\\'s wartime past.Soon after, at the Muncie Fair, another tragedy occurs with the Dillhoefer Circus when Ezra (flying in place of the grounded Waldo) attempts the outside loop in the monoplane.  He crashes on his third attempt, and the crowd rushes out of the stands to see the wreckage.  One of the spectators carelessly flicks a cigarette into gas leaking from the aircraft, igniting it. Helpless against the flames, Waldo kills Ezra with a piece of lumber to spare him the agony of being burned alive. Because no one helped Waldo try to save him, Waldo goes on a rampage, jumps in one of Dillhoefer\\'s aircraft and begins buzzing the crowd away from the wreckage. He ends up crashing into a carnival area, which leads to his permanent grounding.Waldo goes to Hollywood where Axel is working as a stuntman, and Waldo and Axel get jobs as stunt pilots in an upcoming film depicting the air battles of the Great War. Axel has been cleared of his grounding and reinstated as a pilot,  but Waldo uses an alias so that he can dodge his grounding and fly in the film. Famous German air ace Ernst Kessler has also been hired by the producers as a consultant and to fly a Fokker Dr. I replica in the film. (The disillusioned, bitter and heavy drinking depiction of Kessler is based on the real German ace and stunt pilot Ernst Udet.[2])During filming of a famous wartime duel, Waldo in a Sopwith Camel and Kessler in the Fokker—although their aircraft are disarmed—begin dogfighting in deadly earnest, using their aircraft as weapons, repeatedly playing chicken and colliding with each other. Eventually, Waldo damages Kessler\\'s aircraft so badly that it is no longer airworthy, and Kessler surrenders to Waldo. Waldo and Kessler then salute each other and fly their separate ways. As the sound fades, the last shot of the film is of a page in a photo album. One of the pictures is of Waldo, and beneath it is a caption that reads, \"Waldo Pepper. 1895–1931\".',\n",
       " 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines': 'A brief narration outlines man\\'s first attempts to fly since the Stone Age inspired by a bird\\'s flight, seen with footage from the silent film era, and man being represented by a \"test pilot\" (Red Skelton) encountering periodic misfortune in his attempts.In 1910, just seven years after the first heavier-than-air flight, aircraft are fragile and unreliable contraptions, piloted by \"intrepid birdmen\". Pompous British newspaper magnate Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) forbids his would-be aviatrix daughter, ardent suffragette Patricia (Sarah Miles), to fly. Aviator Richard Mays (James Fox), a young army officer and (at least in his own eyes) Patricia\\'s fiancé, conceives the idea of an air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation and his career. With Patricia\\'s support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper.Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press. Invitations and newspaper advertising go out worldwide, and dozens of participants arrive in England with their aircraft. The aircraft are housed and maintained in the hangars at the airfield on the \"Brookley\" Motor Racing Track, where the fliers make practice runs in the days prior to the race. During this time, a wildly mixed international assembly of aviators begins rubbing shoulders with each other, most of them conforming to national stereotypes: The by-the-book, monocle-wearing Prussian officer Colonel Manfred von Holstein (Gert Fröbe), who becomes the victim of Frenchman Pierre Dubois\\' (Jean-Pierre Cassel) various pranks; the impetuous Italian Count Emilio Ponticelli (Alberto Sordi), who buys various aircraft from designer Harry Popperwell (Tony Hancock) and wrecks them in test flights; the unscrupulous British baronet Sir Percy Ware-Armitage (Terry-Thomas), aided by his bullied servant, Courtney (Eric Sykes); and the rugged American cowboy Orvil Newton (Stuart Whitman) who falls for Patricia, forming a love triangle with her and Mays.As the teams test and improve their aircraft in the days before the race, Newton gets caught in the rigging of Sir Percy\\'s plane, which crashes in the nearby sewage farm. Newton later stops the German\\'s aircraft after its tail breaks off and runs out of control. This leads to Patricia falling for him even more and Mays to become more jealous. At a celebration in Brighton, Mays confronts Newton, sparking a fierce rivalry between them for Patricia\\'s hand, just before Japan\\'s official contestant, naval officer Yamamoto, arrives at the airfield.As Yamamoto is officially greeted, Patricia finally convinces Newton to take her flying and they race back to the airfield, followed by Mays and her father, who are intent on stopping them. Not long after taking off, one of the struts on Newton\\'s plane breaks, and Patricia has to fly the plane while Newton repairs it with his belt. When Newton lands, Lord Rawnsley throws him out of the race. Patricia apologizes to Newton, and Rawnsley gives in after Patricia threatens to start an international incident. Meanwhile, Holstein, insulted by the French team\\'s mockery, challenges Dubois to a duel. Dubois agrees, and opts for gas balloons and blunderbusses as his weapons of choice. Both balloons and their pilots end up in the filthy waters of the sewage farm.At the party the night before the race, Sir Percy proceeds to sabotage Yamamoto and Newton\\'s planes, and Rumpelstoss, the designated German pilot, is incapacitated by a laxative meant for Yamamoto. As the competitors take off the next day (with Holstein standing in for Rumpelstoss, using the plane\\'s instruction manual), Yamamoto\\'s aircraft crashes while Newton loses a wheel, although Mays is able to alert him. Fuel blockages and other technical mishaps additionally hamper the fliers, until most of them safely arrive at Dover, their checkpoint before the final flight across the English Channel.That night, Sir Percy cheats by having his aircraft taken across by boat, but is delayed by excited locals when he arrives. Most other contestants, including Holstein, end up crash-landing in the Channel. Sir Percy gets his comeuppance when he becomes disoriented by the smoke from the locomotive of a passenger train between Calais and Paris, forcing him to land his aircraft on one of the cars. As he runs along the top trying to get the driver\\'s attention, the train passes through a tunnel, destroying his aircraft\\'s wings.Coming into Paris, Ponticelli\\'s plane catches fire, and Newton slows down to rescue him as Mays is landing, winning for Britain. Mays recognises Newton\\'s heroism and insists on sharing the glory and the prize with the penniless American, while Ponticelli agrees to give up flying for his family. The only other successful aviator is Dubois, completing his race for France after stopping for more fuel.Patricia chooses Newton in the final scene, breaking the love triangle. Their final kiss is interrupted by a strange noise: they and the others at the field look up to see a flyover by six English Electric Lightning jet fighters, as the time period leaps forward to the \"present\" (1965).Outlined are the still-persisting hazards of modern flying despite today\\'s advanced technology, as a night-time civilian flight across the English Channel is cancelled owing to heavy fog. One of the delayed passengers (Skelton) gets the idea of learning to fly under his own power, perpetuating man\\'s pioneering spirit.',\n",
       " 'Planes (film)': \"Dusty Crophopper is a crop duster plane who works at a cornfield in Propwash Junction and practices aerobatic maneuvers in his spare time, dreaming of becoming a racer. His dreams are scorned by his boss, Leadbottom, and his forklift/mechanic friend, Dottie. However, he is supported by his fuel truck friend, Chug. Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Across the Globe race. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly navy war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well, but Skipper declines. Dusty qualifies for the race on a legal technicality (fifth place qualifier Fonzarelli was disqualified for usage of an illegal fuel-air additive).Skipper decides to mentor Dusty, and discovers Dusty has a fear of heights. With training complete, Dusty travels to New York City to start the race. There, he befriends a Mexican race plane named El Chupacabra, who falls in love with a French-Canadian racer named Rochelle, who shows no interest in him. Three-time winner Ripslinger rudely dismisses Dusty. Dusty falls in love with an Indian racer plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to Iceland, Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place.During the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, Bulldog, from crashing, winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again. After the third leg of the race to Agra in India, Ishani invites Dusty to fly around the Taj Mahal and advises him to fly low through the Himalayas by following some railroad tracks. After flying through a tunnel (and narrowly missing a train), Dusty is in first place at Upper Mustang in Nepal, but he is upset to discover that Ishani deliberately gave him bad advice (implied to be under orders from Ripslinger) in exchange for a new propeller, and he shuns her.The fifth leg is over the Hump (the mountains between northeast India and south China) to Shanghai, where Dusty gets into first place again. There, Dusty manages to help El Chupacabra win over Rochelle with a romantic song, which works a little too well. In the sixth leg of the race across the Pacific, Ripslinger, refusing to lose the rally, has his henchmen Ned and Zed clip off Dusty's navigation antenna. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty comes across the USS Flysenhower, which allows him to land and refuel. On the carrier, Dusty discovers that Skipper only flew one war mission, which contradicts his reputation.Continuing the race, Dusty crashes into the ocean but is rescued. Severely damaged, he is flown to Mexico. Skipper confesses that his one mission leading a squadron of new fighters turned tragic. Skipper was the only survivor, but couldn't bring himself to fly again. Dusty considers dropping out of the race but is encouraged to continue by his fellow competitors, who donate parts to repair the damage he sustained.Racing back to New York, Ripslinger plots to finish off Dusty, but he is thwarted by Skipper. Dusty conquers his fear of heights when he rides a jetstream. Nearing the finish line, Ripslinger slows for the cameras, which allows Dusty to pass him and win, and Ripslinger crashes into portable toilets. Dusty is congratulated by his friends, and Skipper thanks him for giving him the confidence to fly again. Skipper rejoins the navy, flying one last time with Dusty.\",\n",

As George begins to descend the side of the ship on a rope, the order is given to cast off and the deck hands begin to haul in the rope just as George reaches the ship\\'s side belting.

He sees a sidehack bike in the shop and takes a liking to it. Rommel offers J.C. and his group to join him in a sidehack event the upcoming weekend. At the event, J.C. enjoys watching Rommel race on the sidehack. Rommel offers J.C to give a ride on a sidehack with him at his and Rita's cabin, and he accepts.After a fun day of racing on Rommel's sidehack, everyone has a get together dinner party in the cabin. The party soon escalates when J.C. desperately offers Rommel to join his gang, who politely declines, and quickly loses his temper when Dirty John (one of his henchmen) tries asking\\nhim a question and Nero (another henchman of J.C.’s) tries to calm his anger. After trying to seduce Rommel into joining again, his girlfriend, Paisley, reminds him that he’s not interested. Further infuriated, everyone walks out of the cabin and J.C. takes out his anger on Paisley. The next day, while Rommel and Luke are working on a bike, Paisley comes over and tries to seduce Rommel into getting with her, wanting to get away from J.C., but he rejects her and sends her away crying.  Later, when J.C. and his men return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang  find Rommel and Rita in their cabin making love, and they beat Rommel unconscious. With Rommel out cold, they proceed to rape Rita, eventually killing her as a result. Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and his now-deceased fiancée and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being a wanted man, has to hide himself in isolation.Despite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel refuses to let go of what happened to his former fiancée and wants revenge. Planning to kill J.C., he gathers a group of men to back him up, consisting of one of J.C.'s (now former) henchmen Nero (who joined Rommel after finally having enough of J.C.'s abuse), muscle-bound Big Jake, bailed out criminal Crapout, and another one of J.C.'s henchmen, Cooch (who's secretly working undercover for J.C.).With some help from Cooch, Rommel and his gang head out into the canyons where J.C. is hiding. Despite his wife’s concerns about his safety, Luke goes after Rommel to stop him from getting his revenge. Meanwhile, Rommel discusses the plan on what they're going to do to kill J.C., which involves being stealthy, using their hands and no guns in spite of the risk that J.C.'s men may have some on them. They're reluctant on the plan, knowing the possibility of J.C.’s men having guns, but they stick to it regardless.The next morning, Cooch sneaks over to J.C.'s hideout while everyone is still asleep and fills him in on what Rommel plans to do, and after he takes off, J.C. celebrates his victory with Paisley, thinking he has Rommel all figured out. However, Paisley breaks up with J.C. after putting up with all of his abuse and tries to escalate his fury with Rommel. Angry, he strangles Paisley to death, and then apologizes to her dead body and chides her for making him so angry.

Rommel goes over to Luke and asks him to call the police to let them know where J.C. is hiding, finally acknowledging that going after J.C. isn't worth it. However, he still keeps a tied-up Cooch to his side while keeping an eye out on J.C. to make sure he doesn't escape from his hideout, as Rommel's men stick with their intended plan, resulting in Big Jake being killed after taking down two of J.C.'s men through stealth, and Cooch escaping, pleading J.C. not to kill Rommel, only for J.C. to kill his former weasel for being caught. With two of Rommel's men already killed, Nero and Crapout decide to play by their own rules and escape on a bike as the latter kills all of J.C.'s men with a gun instead of a battering ram as he originally planned to use, while J.C. attempts to shoot Rommel after Cooch exposed him.With Rommel and J.C. left in the quarry, no guns on them, the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind.

When their parents are out of the house for the day, Andrea and Andrew decide to have a friendly race on the family track. While racing, Andrew loses control of his bike, causing him to be thrown off and crash, injuring his knee which renders him unable to race in the Cup. Edward is forced to quit his job, dipping into the family\\'s finances to find a replacement rider from Europe.Fueled by her desire to get on the track and feeling guilty over her brother\\'s injury, Andrea forms a plan to masquerade as her brother, to which Andrew reluctantly agrees. Andrea is \"welcomed\" by unfriendly competition and comes back home with a scrape on her arm, which makes her mother, Geneva (Mary-Margaret Humes), suspicious. After dragging the answer out of youngest son Jason (Scott Terra) and a whole night to think it over, Geneva secretly (and reluctantly) agrees to let Andrea race in Andrew\\'s place. The catch, however, is that this all needs to happen behind Edward\\'s back, and before he comes home with a replacement rider.Andrea and her mother arrive at the race venue and register under her brother\\'s name, \"Andy\". In spite of her initial confidence, Andrea learns the hard way that competition is fierce, and finishes last in her first race. Thinking that Andrea is a guy, competitor Dean Talon (Riley Smith) takes notice when the \"lapper\" garners the attention of several young women, finding it unbelievable that a 125 rider is getting looks. Dean, knowing that \"Andrew\" needs help with riding, offers to help the rookie in exchange for advice on his crush, Faryn Henderson (Katherine Ellis).Andrea quickly finds herself falling for Dean, who she reluctantly helps win Faryn\\'s shallow affection.

He is poorly received by Andrea after he tries to hit on her and treats her brothers with disrespect.

Back at camp, the Carson family confront Edward for the way he\\'s treating Andrea. He tries to defend himself, but Geneva and Andrew show him how much he\\'s really hurting Andrea by behaving the way he is. Alone in his thoughts, Edward begins to realize how much racing really means to Andrea and the support the rest of the family has given her. He finds Andrea arguing with Cartier; Andrea says that she\\'s only trying to help her family, and Cartier rudely tells her to back off before shoving her. Edward sees it, runs over to them and shoves Cartier back in retaliation before telling him off and firing him. He and Andrea then go for a walk, where Edward tells her that he is proud of her for bringing Carson Racing to where it is now. Andrea admits her only regret was that instead of Andrew that got injured, it was her. Edward tells her not to think about anything else, and allows her to race in the final heat.On the final race, Andrea and Cartier, now racing under Art Henderson Racing, find themselves fighting fiercely for the finish. When Cartier fumbles on a turn, Andrea takes the victory and finishes 1st. However, an angry Cartier exposes her during a live interview, much to the shock of the entire community and Dean\\'s dismay. A heated argument between the Carson family and Art Henderson Racing gets under way about disqualifying Andrea by saying that a girl isn\\'t allowed to compete, which Geneva argues, saying that she read the rules and it doesn\\'t mention anywhere about girls not being allowed to race. Henderson then tries to argue that Andrea wasn\\'t registered, and Geneva pulls out the registration form showing that Andrea did register under \"Andy Carson\", as it is short for Andrea. Barbara Rollins (Aloma Wright), the corporate CEO, expresses her inspiration at Andrea\\'s actions, much to Henderson and Cartier\\'s embarrassment.

In narration, Kid quotes his dad as saying “the difference between men and boys is the lessons they learn” and adds that his father taught him plenty.Kid practices stunts on the set and meets Tina (Meagan Good), while an eager, local biker issues a challenge to Smoke, who accepts. Smoke, casually utilizing “tunnel vision”, wins the race but the challenger loses control when his bike suffers a hydraulics malfunction well over 100 MPH and crashes into a row of parked bikes. Upended, the motorcycle is sent flipping though the air, striking Slick Will and throwing him through a plate storefront window. Both men are instantly killed. At Slick Will\\'s funeral, Smoke leads dozens of bikers from the \"Black Knights\", to personally offer his condolences to Slick Will’s widow Anita (Vanessa Bell Calloway) and drops a signed Black Knights flag into his grave. Kid is unimpressed with the gesture and triggered. Six months later, Kid is now a capable rider with his own custom-powered bike. Winning his first \"race\" by dangerously interfering in a challenge between a drunken biker and biker Donny (Tyson Beckford) , Kid displays his speed and skill, successfully pulling off stunts hinted at earlier. The crowd loves it, much to the dissatisfaction of Smoke. Kid calls Smoke out to challenge but the latter dismisses this and tells the inexperienced youth to get more experience and clout first.At a diner, Kid meets the “drunk” racer Stuntman (Brendan Fehr) where it is revealed that the two are secret hustling partners and they split the winnings. To cover their tracks, fellow biker Primo (Rick Gonzalez) suggests that the trio form a bike club and after a bit of persuasion they agree. Kid also tracks down Tina, a tattoo artist and the two start a romance.Kid makes amends to the biker jury consisting of 10 leaders of the most powerful biker gangs. He apologizes for his disrespect, specifically towards their chairman - Smoke and they agree to verify the new club with the trio calling themselves \"Biker Boyz\".

A lawyer for the Black Knights bails Kid out and Anita confronts him, threatening to evict Kid from her house if he races again.The night of the Black Knights annual dance, Kid is challenged by proxy to race Dogg and accepts after a squabble with Tina’s brother and Strays mechanic (Larenz Tate) Wood. Having overheard, Anita finds Smoke before the race and demands that he stop it. Smoke and Anita argue until she relents, telling Smoke that Kid is actually his son and not Slick Will\\'s. Incredulous, Smoke is moved to act and manages to draw Kid into an altercation. Kid attacks Smoke but the veteran confiscates Kid’s keys and knocks him out cold, successfully averting the race. Recovering at home, Kid confronts Anita, who confesses decades old truths. Enraged and grief stricken, Kid leaves home and moves in with his girlfriend Tina. Kid elects to go rogue and after gaining more followers for his club, gathers his team, declaring \"we\\'re gonna win more lids than any crew on the set and we\\'re gonna out hustle every crew off the set\" and indicates at reinvention, \"Biker Boyz set their own rules.\" The Biker Boyz get their own hangout and begin hustling several races, but when Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is quickly overpowered by the leader of the other club who pulls a gun. Smoke and a group of Black Knights intervene to settle terms and convince the vengeful bikers to stand down. Smoke and Kid have a sit down at the Biker Boyz spot but Kid is more dismissive and angry as ever. Aggravated, Smoke finally agrees to race Kid, under the condition that whoever loses will never race again; but first Smoke has to allow Kid to race Dogg at the next circuit event. Soon thereafter Kid reconciles with Anita.At the race track, Kid and his team face the Strays with Smoke and the Black Knights at watch from the stands. Dogg and Kid race down the strip until Dogg does a “bump and run“ causing Kid to “lay the bike down” into a crash. Although Kid is unhurt, his bike is wrecked. Later that day, Smoke informs Kid that the authorities are closing the track, due to the amount of crashes, but he has managed to rent a farm outside of town, securing their race. Kid agrees to arrive the next day. Later that night, Kid, Primo, and Stuntman are trying unsuccessfully to fix Kid\\'s bike when the Strays arrive to confront them. Wood confirms that the damage is too severe to mend in time for the race. Dogg concedes that only their bikes are as strong and fast as Smoke’s. As a peace offering, Dogg lends Kid his bike, giving the youth a viable shot at winning.The following day, Black Knights and Biker Boyz arrive and line up in opposing formation in the open field, not unlike an old western showdown. Smoke calls for a fair race, with no nitrous oxide system; Kid wants Tina to call the start. Smoke and Kid race on a dirt road behind the farm and Kid adopts Smoke’s “tunnel vision” with the finish line in sight. On course to win, Smoke is suddenly filled with emotions and instead slows down to let his son win - giving way to Kid becoming the new \"King of Cali\".Smoke, impressed and proud, relinquishes the crown to a humbled and respectful Kid who tells Smoke to keep his helmet. The two men reconcile their differences and enjoy an embrace. Kid watches on as his father rides off into the sunset and in narration repeats Slick Will’s sentiment in full context that “the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn” and adds that his father taught him plenty.',\n",

Burt ignores this advice, and is given medication.Burt is finally able to save enough to travel by cargo ship to Los Angeles, working his passage as the cook, but when he arrives, he experiences bureaucracy, skepticism, and the indifference of big city people.  It is his blunt but gregarious nature which overcomes each hurdle.  He wins over the motel clerk, a transgender woman named Tina, who assists him in clearing customs and helps him in buying a car.  The car salesman allows Burt to use his workshop and junkyard to build a trailer, and later offers him a job after Burt fine-tunes a number of the cars on the lot.  Burt declines the offer, however, and shortly afterwards begins his long trip to Utah.Along the way, Burt meets numerous helpful people, including highway police, a Native American who aids him when his trailer fails, a woman named Ada who allows him to repair his trailer in her garage and briefly becomes his lover, and an Air Force pilot who is on leave from military service in Vietnam.He finally arrives at the Bonneville Salt Flats, only to be blocked by race officials for not registering his motorcycle for competition in advance, and not having the mandated safety equipment.  In a show of sportsmanship, however, various competitors and fans in the Bonneville series intervene on his behalf, and he is eventually allowed to make a timed run.  Despite various problems, he succeeds in his quest and sets a new land speed record at the 8th mile of his run; when he reaches 201.851\\xa0mph (324.847\\xa0km/h). By the end, his leg is burned by the exhaust, and he then falls with the motorcycle and skids to a stop, but he is able to return home to New Zealand as a hero. An epilogue describes that he went to Bonneville again several times to compete and set new records.\",\n",

The crew goes on to finish 28th, a very unimpressive placing for a Varsity squad boat.Topolski is then shown berating the squad, and the other coaches share concerns about the form of the athletes, particularly Ross. Topolski decides to look at the results of the Trial Eights race, which initially looks good, but is marred by a clash of blades.The Americans later rebel against the coaches and say they will walk out if Ross is not selected. In the end none of the Americans row and Topolski goes with a less experienced crew. After initial tensions the crew comes together and trains well for the last few weeks before the race.

On Carruthers\\' arrival on Germany\\'s northern coast to join the yacht Dulcibella, Davies explains to him that he has a hidden agenda for the trip and the invitation beyond duck-hunting. While boating around the Frisian Islands ostensibly correcting antiquated British sea charts of the coastline\\'s shifting topography, by chance he had met a retired German sailor called Dollmann on the yacht Medusa with his wife and daughter, Clara, with whom Davies has initiated a romantic attachment. He narrates further that whilst sailing together along the coast in a gale Dollmann had, when Davies had tried to put into a particular estuary for shelter, inexplicably prevented him from entering by executing a deliberately hazardous sea-manoeuvre, to the degree that both their lives had been endangered by it. Davies then reveals to Carruthers that his real interest in the area is that he suspects that the Imperial German Navy is engaged in covert military activity of some nature in the Frisian Islands, with the intention of threatening the security of the North Sea from the British perspective, which the Royal Navy is strategically misdirected to meet, and he is engaged in trying to discover what it is. This the pretext of the \"holiday\" that he has invited Carruthers upon, given Carruthers\\' ability to speak German along with his professional contacts within Whitehall, if they should discover something warranting the alarm being raised within the halls of the British Government.Carruthers and Davies go on, amidst cryptic warnings-off from circling German naval officers, sailing expeditions among the Frisian isles and inlets, and fights, to carry out covert surveillance at the estuary in question, to discover that the German Empire is using a naval base hidden in the islands to carry out rehearsals for a seaborne passage across the North Sea of a German army with the aim of militarily invading Britain, and that Herr \"Dollmann\" is in fact Lieutenant Thomas, an embittered former Royal Navy officer who is treasonously assisting their preparations with his detailed knowledge of the British coast and key naval defences.After sabotaging one of the rehearsals, whilst escaping to the Netherlands by sea in two roped yachts with the information about it, along with a badly wounded Dollmann and his family as prisoners, Davies abandons Dollmann with his wife in the Dulcibella to allow him to return to Germany to seek medical attention for his wounds at the insistence of Clara, who agrees to accompany Davies and Carruthers back to Britain in the Medusa with his papers revealing the German plans in detail. Dollmann and his wife are murdered by the pursuing German authorities\\xa0— led by Kaiser Wilhelm II, in person\\xa0— when the Dulcibella is rammed and destroyed.The film ends with the yacht bearing Carruthers, Davies and Clara bound for the Netherlands, with a Carruthers\\' voiced narration detailing how their return to Britain with the information would lead to a shift in the United Kingdom\\'s sea defence strategy towards Germany, that would avert the threat of war by tactical deterrent.',\n",

While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a balsawood raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1,500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 nautical mile–journey across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a macaw named Lorita).During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of sun and storm, Kon-Tiki, the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea.With support from the US government, he eventually reaches Polynesia.

The boat capsizes and rights itself; during a second roll, which throws the man overboard again, the boat is dis-masted and most of the equipment is destroyed. After going below deck and being knocked out by colliding with a post, he regains consciousness to find the boat sinking, so he abandons ship in an inflatable life raft. When the storm is past, he salvages whatever he can from his sinking boat and transfers it to the raft.

A professional bowler, Danny left the family with his father, but he accepts the cousins\\' invitation to return — after rolling a gutter ball in a big tournament and finding out that he has a pre-arthritic condition developing in his wrist.Danny\\'s television sports producer and girlfriend Robin encourages him to ask Uncle Joe for a loan of $300,000 to invest in a bowling alley. A typically rude and crude Joe says he will lend the money only if Danny sides with him against his own father. Danny is offended and leaves with his girlfriend, much to the annoyance of the other relatives. They confront Molly later on and she realizes just how conniving and desperate they are for Uncle Joe\\'s fortune.Uncle Joe asks Danny to visit him at his scrapyard, to apologize for trying to bribe him, but the old man calls a number to place a shipping order to a company he finds out has been closed for 25 years. Realizing that his relatives could declare him incompetent and throw him in a retirement home, he tells Danny that he plans to hand his fortune over to Molly. Danny realizes how much he\\'d like to inherit his fortune and tells him not to rush into anything.Danny moves in with Uncle Joe and starts competing for his money, even so far as to sing a Jimmy Durante song that Joe loved him to perform as a little kid. But Molly has other ideas and decides to use her \"assets\" to outdo Danny and have sex with the elderly gentleman, if only to keep the relatives from getting his money. But after her successful attempt to get Joe in the bedroom, they are interrupted by Danny\\'s father Daniel and he and Danny engage in an heated argument, in which Danny chooses Uncle Joe over him. Molly feels disgusted with herself for almost having sex with Joe and tells Danny she has to leave, but not before Danny promises to look after Joe. However, Danny tells Robin that he\\'d actually hired an actor to play his \"so-called\" father, to win favor with his Uncle, and she feels he\\'s become too greedy and leaves him.At Joe\\'s attorney\\'s office, Danny is ready to inherit Joe\\'s fortune when his relatives arrive with his real father. Danny admits that he\\'s become as bad as the rest of the family. But it soon becomes apparent that Uncle Joe is not only bankrupt, he is in debt of $95,000. After a big scene that involves Frank fighting Danny, the relatives leave and Joe tells Danny that he was simply \"playing them\" to find out who actually loved him. Danny tells him \"nobody loves you\" and leaves to make up with Robin. When Danny asks Joe\\'s butler Douglas where Uncle Joe is, Douglas says that he doesn\\'t know. Danny has a change of heart and realizes that no matter what Joe did to trick them, he\\'s still family and loves him. He also tells Robin about it after getting her attention with holding a \"He was broke\" sign at a sporting event she was covering. Danny makes up with her.With Joe\\'s ill health, no money. and no place to go, Danny and Robin decide to let Joe stay with them in their apartment. But Joe gives them another surprise, and reveals that he still has a fortune and they see Molly and Douglas standing outside. He suggests they stay with him saying \"Whatever I own, you own\". Danny accepts on the condition that all of the lies and the games stop. Uncle Joe agrees and finishes his final lie by calmly getting off his wheelchair and exiting their apartment whilst a shocked Danny and Robin watch.',\n",

In his professional bowling tour debut, he defeats established pro Ernie McCracken, who takes the loss poorly and seeks revenge. McCracken convinces Roy to join him in hustling a group of local amateur bowlers. When the amateurs become furious after realizing they are being conned, McCracken flees while Roy is brutally beaten and loses his hand when it is forced into the ball return, ending his career. Seventeen years later, Roy uses a prosthetic hand and is living in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as an alcoholic, unsuccessful traveling salesman of bowling supplies. He is always behind on his rent and is constantly harassed by his landlady, Mrs. Dumars, eventually being reduced to trade sexual favors with her for a break on his back rent.On a sales visit to a nearby bowling alley, Roy meets Ishmael Boorg. Roy tries to convince Ishmael to turn pro, with Roy acting as manager. Ishmael declines, explaining that he is from the local Amish community and that his bowling hobby is a secret and must hide it from his family. Roy then sees a poster in a bowling magazine advertising a $1\\xa0million winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. Learning that Ishmael's family is about to lose their farm to the bank, Roy eventually convinces Ishmael's family to let him join Roy, under the guise of going on a mission trip.Roy discovers that the childlike Ishmael is not aware of some of bowling's basic rules and skills. (His 270 average was because he was taught to bowl fifteen frames and not the standard ten.) However, after some coaching, Ishmael improves. The duo earn money in various local tournaments and by hustling bowlers. Ishmael defeats a wealthy bowling enthusiast named Stanley Osmanski, but Stanley attacks the duo after discovering that the roll of cash Roy put up was fake. As the group flee Osmanski's mansion, his girlfriend Claudia, who had also been a victim of Osmanski's violence, joins them. Roy suspects Claudia has ulterior motives and is distracting Ishmael. After Roy gets in a fistfight with her, Ishmael flees. During his absence, Roy and Claudia drive on and end up back in Roy's hometown and at his childhood home, which has been abandoned ever since his father died years earlier. Roy then confesses to Claudia he never returned for his father's funeral out of shame for his failure as a pro bowler. They eventually call a truce, find Ishmael and continue on to Reno.In Reno, the group runs into McCracken, who is now a national bowling superstar. McCracken insults and makes fun of Roy and infuriates Ishmael, who attempts to punch McCracken but instead hits a wall and breaks his hand, leaving him unable to bowl. Later on, Claudia disappears with all of their money after being discovered by Stanley. Feeling distraught, Ishmael convinces Roy that they still have a chance to win $1 million if Roy bowls. Roy enters the tournament, rolling the ball with his prosthetic rubber hand. He rediscovers his touch, progresses through several rounds, and eventually ends up in the televised finals against McCracken. During the final match, Ishmael's brother, who had been sent by the Boorg family, arrives and takes Ishmael back to Pennsylvania. When Roy realizes he is alone, he struggles and McCracken wins the tournament by one pin.Afterwards, Roy returns to his Pennsylvania apartment and pours his liquor down the drain. He is visited by Claudia, who explains she had disappeared with Stanley in Reno to keep him from hurting Roy and Ishmael. She made Stanley believe she was running away with McCracken to give McCracken payback off-screen, and confesses her love for Roy, offering him money Stanley earned from gambling on McCracken in the finals. Roy responds that he is going to make $500,000 in an endorsement deal for Trojan Condoms based on his prosthetic rubber hand. Roy and Claudia visit Ishmael's family home. Ishmael's parents explain that Roy and Claudia told them about Ishmael's forbidden bowling career, but also about the moral strength and decency he showed during his travels. Roy tells them how Ishmael straightened out Roy and Claudia's lives, with Roy shown to have finally given up drinking. Roy pays off the Boorg family's debts with his endorsement check, and Roy and Claudia kiss before driving away together.\",\n",

He learns of Australian brothers Carl and Mark Doohan\\'s forthcoming tour of England, and plans to get selected for the national team. Starkey would play through the tournament undefeated, defeating veteran player (and thirteen times champion) Ray Speight (James Cromwell). After winning the competition, and becoming eligible to play for England, Speight, the head of the local lawn bowls association, bans Starkey for fifteen years for writing an expletive on an opponent\\'s scorecard.

With both players failing at half time, Trevor and Kerry talk to the pair, and get them to work as a team to make a comeback.

They discover the abbey is built above a vast cave system, but it is completely blocked off by an intricate floor mosaic. Trying to blast their way in, they cause a landslide that buries the abbey, trapping the men in the cavern below. They descend further into the cave in hopes of finding a way out, even as they hear strange sounds in the darkness.Some time later, present day, a new team, led by Dr. Nicolai, with his associate Dr. Kathryn Jennings and cameraman Alex Kim explore the site, and the mythology behind the winged demons depicted in the mosaic on the abbey's floor. Local biologists believe the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem, so they hire a group of American spelunkers led by brothers Jack and Tyler McAllister – thrill-seeking professional cave explorers who run a world-famous team of divers. They arrive in Romania with a modified rebreather allowing a diver to remain submerged for up to 24 hours. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie, first scout Briggs, sonar expert Strode, and survival expert Top Buchanan.Briggs is chosen to scout ahead; when contact is lost, the group presses on in the likelihood it is simply an equipment malfunction. After the group finds Briggs safely downriver, Strode is suddenly attacked and dragged away by a large, unknown creature. His water scooter explodes and causes a cave-in, forcing them to follow the river and search for a new way out. Jennings and Nicolai discover a strange parasite in all of the lifeforms they find. Unlike the known cave species, which have adapted over generations to life underground, Jennings believes this new parasite originated in the cave environment and has never been exposed to the outside world. The team stumble across the equipment and remains of previous explorers, unaware they are being stalked by the creatures.They descend through a series of rapids, where Nicolai is attacked and Jack goes after him. Nicolai is dragged into a crevice but Jack breaks free, injured, after seeing letters tattooed on one of the creatures. Jack's senses and physical features begin to transform. When Jack tells them they must go back up to escape, Charlie scales the wall and is attacked by a creature hidden in the passage above. She nearly drops to her death, but recovers, before the human-sized winged creature kills her on the cliff face in full view of the team. As Jack exhibits super-keen senses and inhumanly slanted pupils, Jennings speculates that Jack, the previous explorers, and all the ecosystem's creatures mutated due to the parasite; and the infected humans resemble demons. Witnessing Jack's transformation, some of the survivors question his judgement and the team splits up. Alex, Briggs, and Jennings go their own way, while Top and Tyler stay with Jack.Jack, Top, and Tyler discover a cavern littered with human skeletons and realize this is the ancient battleground depicted in the abbey's artwork; the abbey's residents sealed the cave to prevent the creatures from escaping. After they see daylight through the underwater passage ahead, Tyler goes back to find the others, but Briggs dies defending Jennings and Alex, while the creatures enter the cavern and steal the rebreathers necessary to navigate the passage. Alex is killed before they can get in the water, but Jack sacrifices himself battling the creatures while Tyler, Jennings and Top escape.The three survivors return to civilization, and Top departs. Tyler asks Jennings if Jack could have survived in the open. She responds that she originally thought the parasite could only survive underground, but is now uncertain and thinks that it wants to get out. She bends down to kiss his cheek, revealing her pupils are like Jack's. As Katheryn walks away, Tyler realizes she knows she is infected with the parasite and intends to remain free, able to infect others. He runs after her, but she disappears in the crowd.\",\n",

Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a cyclone, causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through \"the elevator\" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to \"forward camp\" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape. Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria\\'s line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him.The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude\\'s old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully drowns him.\\nThe team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George—an experienced, veteran diver—has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realises that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria\\'s death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII Japanese tank collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately, the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.A little later they discover Carl who has gone completely insane and found Victoria\\'s corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank for Victoria\\'s death but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a stalagmite which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realised and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel.A short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. Just as he begins to lose hope, Josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean. He emerges from the water and crawls onto the beach, where he is discovered by fishermen.',\n",

As he heals, Sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him, but he cannot say the words in return. When Eddie is ready to play, he agrees to Bert\\'s terms, deciding that a \"25% slice of something big is better than a 100% slice of nothing\".Bert, Eddie, and Sarah travel to the Kentucky Derby, where Bert arranges a match for Eddie against a wealthy local socialite named Findley.

Their friend Jack then arrives. His pool playing skills come to the attention of Holden (Kirk Torrance), who remarks to the bartender Dave (John Leigh) that the three friends might be good enough to play in \"Daddy\\'s game\". \"Daddy\\'s game\" turns out to be an underground pool tournament run by local Greek crime lord Daddy. Each team pays $500 to enter and the winner takes away $20,000 tax free. The three of them agree to enter under the name \"Stickmen\".The boys leave the bar and go to a cafe, where they meet Sara (Anne Nordhaus), a waitress who takes a liking to Thomas. The next morning the three meet up for breakfast where Jack tells them that their first match in the pool tournament will be against two men called Jimmy and Eric, at the Princess Bar. Jack then leaves for work, where he ends up having sex with Karen (Simone Kessell) in his office. Thomas attends a course on \"Coping with Redundancy\" but is asked to leave. He runs into Sara, who is doing a management course. The two go for a cup of coffee, which Thomas reluctantly accepts because he has a girlfriend. Later that evening, Thomas accompanies Wayne to a job interview, which turns out to be an escort driver. He will be responsible for driving prostitutes Tess (Emma Nooyen) and Lulu (Luanne Gordon) to their jobs. The madam, Janelle, reveals that Daddy owns the brothel. Wayne gets the job.Meanwhile, Dave is having trouble coming up with the rent for his bar, which he rents from Daddy. Holden turns up and after some friendly chitchat, tells Dave that the cheque bounced. He breaks Dave\\'s thumb and promises him that if he doesn\\'t get the money, the next one will be a beating.The Stickmen turn up to their match at the Princess Bar, which appears to be a gay bar. They easily win the match and go back to celebrate at Dave\\'s bar. Sara turns up and she and Thomas hit it off. Karen arrives and chats with Jack. Thomas and Sara, drunk, leave the bar. Holden tells Jack and Wayne that Daddy wants to meet them, and they agree to meet the next morning.The next morning, Jack and Wayne turn up to Daddy\\'s barber shop, which is in a small alley. Thomas doesn\\'t show and it is revealed that he slept with Sara. Holden arrives and tells Jack and Wayne that their next match will be against the Men in Black, who are rumoured to be very good. They go inside and meet Daddy, who has two metal hooks instead of hands. He has a number of Greek thugs as bodyguards. He tells them that life is nothing without passion, and his passion is getting players together in his pool tournament.Thomas returns home and finds his girlfriend Marie has packed up his stuff and wants him to leave, having suspected his infidelity. He arrives at the bar and is congratulated by Jack and Wayne for sleeping with Sara. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Sara and Karen know each other and are planning something.The Men in Black, the Stickmen\\'s next opponents, turn out to be two priests. They are humorous and good-natured even when the Stickmen beat them. Thomas goes to visit Sara and the two of them bond. Holden tells Jack that Daddy wants another meeting. Jack accompanies Holden and sees Daddy intimidating Dave while shaving him. Dave, who had previously been beaten up by Daddy\\'s thugs, is given two days to get Daddy\\'s money. Daddy then gives Jack a haircut while offering him a bet of $15,000 on the tournament. Jack protests that they don\\'t have that kind of money but Daddy says that they can work out a payment plan. Feeling intimidated, Jack agrees to the bet.The next morning at breakfast Jack breaks the news to the other two that their next match will be against \"Caller\" (Neville Stevenson), and he remarks that the only way they have a hope is if they win the toss. Sara tells Karen that she\\'s not sure if she can go through with their plan. Karen\\'s ex-boyfriend Hugh and his friend turn up and Sara leaves. She meets Thomas at the Bucket Fountain on Cuba Street, where they agree to take their relationship to the next level (being boyfriend and girlfriend).The next evening, Wayne rescues Lulu from a fat, drunken customer, who has passed out on top of her. He invites her to come and watch him play pool to cheer her up, and takes her home to get his cue. However, he finds that Tess, who had been living with him temporarily, has stolen most of his stuff. He explodes in a fit of anger, starts drinking and tells Lulu that Caller is too good and they can\\'t beat him. After some encouragement from Lulu, he agrees to play.Caller, it turns out, is a pierced, bare-chested pool player with dreadlocks who gets his nickname from calling his shots. Wayne turns up drunk and announces to Thomas and Jack that he will play Caller. Jack objects, knowing that he is the only one who has a chance at winning, but Holden states that since Wayne has stepped up, he has to play. In a \"drunken master\" style, Wayne runs the table and beats Caller, who never gets a single shot. As Holden mentioned earlier in the film, New Zealand pub rules require a player who loses a game without sinking any of his balls to drop his trousers. Caller appears to comply with the rule, but then punches Wayne in the face. In the resulting fight, Jack\\'s hand is cut. Holden, backed up by two of Daddy\\'s thugs wielding machetes, forces Caller to drop his trousers.Due to Jack\\'s injury, he is barely able to play pool, meaning that Thomas and Wayne will have to play in the semi-finals. Knowing that they have lost their star player, they decide to quit. Dave convinces them to keep playing by telling them that he gets to keep the bar if they win. He buys them matching jackets to wear to the finals.At the semi-finals, Holden announces that their opponent is \"Bastinados\", who turn out to be Sara and Karen. The other match is the \"Farmers\" versus the \"Bankers\" (Hugh and his friend). Karen and Sara are exceptionally good, but Sara throws the game by sinking the cue ball on the same shot as the 8-ball. In the break between the game, Sara and Thomas go to the roof to talk, where she tells him that she threw the game and really cares about him. Jack takes Wayne and gets him drunk in the hopes that he will repeat his performance against Caller. Daddy, not wanting the Stickmen to win, locks Thomas and Sara on the roof.Wayne steps up to the break of the final match against the Bankers but passes out on the table. Jack has to play, being the only one left. However, Holden rescues Thomas and Sara, and Thomas proceeds to win the game for the Stickmen. Hugh snaps his cue over his knee in anger and storms out. Daddy tells them to stop by his barber shop next week to collect the money.A few weeks later, we see that Dave has done up his bar, which is now a successful establishment, and the film ends with the Stickmen playing a friendly game of pool in the bar.',\n",
       " 'Poolhall Junkies': 'Most of the film takes place in a pool hall run by Nick (Rod Steiger). Obsessed by the world of pool, Johnny (Mars Callahan) could be one of the best. But his mentor Joe (Chazz Palminteri), a shady stakehorse, trains Johnny as a hustler, and decides how and who Johnny plays. Unbeknownst to Johnny, Joe has been holding him back from his dream: playing in the legitimate pro tour.  When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, throwing a game with a large pot.  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny\\'s bridge hand outside the pool hall (an homage to a similar scene in the classic pool film The Hustler).  Joe is later beaten up by some of Johnny\\'s friends as a warning to leave him alone.After an ultimatum from his girlfriend Tara (Alison Eastwood), Johnny largely leaves the world of pool hustling, and finally commits to a \"real\" job in the construction business, but is soon miserable there. He finds himself spending most of his time with his younger brother Danny (Michael Rosenbaum), a musician with aspirations of following in Johnny\\'s hustler footsteps, despite Johnny\\'s discouragement of this path.  Johnny meets Tara\\'s wealthy uncle, Mike (Christopher Walken); he and Johnny hustle some of Mike\\'s business associates, one an executive at Tara\\'s employer. Rather than bet money or on himself, Johnny wagers a high-placed position for Tara, with Mike putting up an expensive car as their side of the stake.  Johnny wins a challenging trick-shot bet (to duplicate a difficult shot Mike had made in the previous game), and the promotion for Tara, but keeps the reason for her new opportunity a secret. (She eventually figures out the reason behind her advancement to such a competitive position, but understands that Johnny was just trying to help her the only way he knew how.)As for Joe, he is bent on revenge for the beating he took, and soon he has a new protégé, Brad (Rick Schroder), who is just as good as, if not better, than Johnny. Joe also has his eye on Johnny\\'s brother as a mark for Brad\\'s hustling.  Brad and Danny play a high-stakes game of pool which ends in a huge debt owed to Joe by Danny, who was no match for Brad.  Johnny later finds that his brother is in jail for trying to steal the money he owes, and that Joe is going to come after Johnny for the money.  The only way out is for Johnny to play against Brad for an even larger sum – to pay off Joe and fund his brother\\'s legal defense.  This results in a race-to-nine showdown that pits two of the greatest players against each other for a large sum of money – and perhaps even for Johnny and Danny\\'s lives.  One of the brothers\\' affluent friends puts up some of the stake money, and Mike provides the rest, then even increases the stakes.  During a tense time-out, Mike delivers a memorable monologue (in Walken\\'s intense style, as most famously used in Pulp Fiction), likening Johnny to a slumbering lion whose time has come to rise up and chase off the hyenas and jackals.  Mike then raises the stakes, to a level that will bankrupt Joe if Brad loses.The match comes down to a very difficult final shot for Brad. Johnny sharks Brad while he is calculating how to take the shot, telling him how easy the shot is and how Johnny would even pay to take that shot for him. Smelling an opportunity to get more money from Johnny, Joe agrees and makes Brad let Johnny attempt the shot.  Johnny does so, but does not pocket the final ball. As Brad prepares to take the winning shot, Johnny stops him: since he paid for the privilege of taking Brad\\'s turn for him, it is now Johnny\\'s own turn again.  Before Brad or Joe can react, Johnny easily pockets the last ball and wins the match, having exploited the hustling techniques he learned from Joe to do so.  Joe is prepared to resort to violence again, but Johnny predicted this and has the same friends who roughed up Joe before drag him away.  Brad stays out of it, and on his way out of the pool hall suggests Johnny should get onto the pro tour.  In the closing shot, Johnny is shown happily playing a pro-tour match.  (The resolution of Danny\\'s legal trouble is left as a loose end.)',\n",

Just minutes before a game, he and Kate collide in a hallway in the arena. During the game, Doug suffers a head injury that permanently damages his peripheral vision, costing him a shot to play in the NHL and forcing him to retire from ice hockey. During Kate's event, her partner apparently accidentally drops her, albeit with little sign of regret or concern, during their program, costing them a chance at the gold medal.While training for the 1992 Winter Olympics over the next two years, Kate drives away all potential skating partners with her attitude and perfectionism. Her coach, Russian native Anton Pamchenko, has to find a replacement, an outsider who doesn't know that Kate is spoiled and difficult.He tracks down Doug, who is back home in Minnesota, working in a steel mill and as a carpenter on the side, living with his brother, and playing in a hockey bar league.

Hogan has trouble concentrating and freezes; he considers giving up, but Valerie talks him out of it. They go on, traveling around the country from tournament to tournament, following the sun in the caravan that is the pro tour.At the Oakland Open, the Hogans are down to $5 and are weary of a diet of oranges. He ties for 6th, winning $285, and Valerie exclaims that the gallery doesn’t scare him anymore. However, the price of Ben’s concentration is a reputation for being aloof.His career prospers in the next few years, but World War II interrupts. After serving in the Air Force, Hogan returns to golfing  and becomes a great champion. He is still unable to talk to fans or clown around, and has acquired an image in the media of a robotic, cold competitor with the nickname “The Texas Iceberg.” He envies Williams his easy way with fans.At the Bing Crosby Tournament in Pebble Beach, he wins, beating Williams. His former commanding officer says hello but Ben doesn’t see him, he is concentrating so much on the game. Ben apologizes when the general tells him about it after the tournament and chastises himself for not being able to play golf and play to the gallery at the same time and give the fans what they want. Meanwhile Williams has developed a drinking problem that is interfering with his golf and breaking up his marriage to Norma (June Havoc).Hogan is now the biggest money winner in golf. A fictional tournament described in the film as “The Big One” in Los Angeles, pits Williams and Hogan against each other. Hogan wins and Williams and his wife mysteriously move on without a word.In 1949, on their way back to Fort Worth, Texas, to move into a home Valerie has bought for them, a bus drives head-on into their car on a fog-bound road. The film re-creates Hogan throwing himself in front of his wife to protect her, an act of selflessness that also saved him: The steering wheel impaled the driver’s seat.At first, the police think Hogan is dead.  He has crush injuries to his pelvis, legs and shoulder. The doctors are afraid of clot formation and the necessary specialist is in New Orleans. Valerie calls Gen. Richardson and he arranges for a plane to fly there. The operations are successful, but there is a long road  ahead. Dr. Graham (Roland Winters) suggests taking one hurdle at a time.Hogan is amazed by the outpouring of regard from his fans; his hospital room is flooded with flowers, cards and letters. “I should have taken my eye off the ball and taken a good look at people,” he says. He’d like “to play just once more for the gallery.” Chuck and Norma Williams, now happy together, come to the hospital room with golf legends Jimmy Demaret and Dr. Cary Middlecoff, who tell Hogan he is to be captain of the team when they go to England for the Ryder Cup, whether or not he can play.Through determination and exercise he becomes well enough to go home, where he steadily recovers. (The fact that very little screen time is spent on his rehabilitation may intentionally reflect the amazing speed of Hogan’s real-life recovery.) One day, Valerie comes home to find he has taken a taxi to a driving range. The ballboy tells him he needs to pivot, shift his weight from leg to leg, and in trying this, Hogan falls. Valerie is afraid and angry—the doctors have warned him not to play golf because the danger of clots will never go away. She “can’t take it.” But after watching him suffer sitting  alone at home wishing he could play, she changes her mind.Newspaper headlines announce that ”Iron Man” Hogan will play in the 1950 Los Angeles Open, traditionally the opening event of the professional golf season. Re-creation of the tournament  includes appearances by Dr. Cary Middlecoff, Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and others. Williams, who says he withdrew from the tournament because going on the wagon has given him the shakes, comes to the locker room to give Hogan a pep talk. Ben asks him to level with him, and Williams says that it’s about the legs, the stamina needed. Hogan “can’t shoot 69s for four days in a row on guts.”This time the big gallery is rooting for him, and Hogan does well even through days of pouring rain. The sun comes out on the 18th green, and Hogan ends with 69 for the last round, leading the field. The Hogans and Williamses listen to the radio as Sam Snead matches Hogan’s score, making a playoff necessary. Hogan loses to Snead in the playoff, but is applauded and honored at a tribute dinner from the “sportswriting fraternity” with Grantland Rice playing himself as toastmaster. Hogan gives a brief but moving speech, and the film ends with a re-creation of the TIME magazine cover honoring Hogan’s 1950 win of the U.S. Open.In real life, Hogan’s greatest golfing achievements were still to come, and in the 21st century he is considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game.\",\n",

He supposedly has offered to split a winner's purse with a competitor, Jonathan Linus, if his opponent deliberately misses a final putt. In fact, the competitor is the one who approached him.  McDermot refuses, so Jonathan Linus goes to another pro, Tommy Del Gaddo, whose glory days were behind him. Then they turn in McDermot, accusing him of their crime.Linus retires from the PGA Tour and marries into a rich family.  His wife is the daughter of a wealthy businessman in Arizona; through their money, they are now principals (President and General Manager) of an exclusive golf club, the El Presidente. Del Gaddo becomes the head pro at the club as reward for supporting Linus in winning the Eastern Open.McDermot, now calling himself Mike Banning, arrives and threatens to expose them, so he is given the assistant pro's job to quiet him.  Banning proceeds to lure the club's high rollers to stage a high-wager golf tournament, a Calcutta, in which two-man teams are auctioned off. All money is then put in a pot and split three ways between the teammates and their bidder.Banning must win this tournament to make enough money, $21,000, to pay off the mob, which had bankrolled his trial on the PGA Tour.  He is literally playing for his life (and that of his dentist who actually took out the loan).Banning knows the President cheats; he plays high-stakes poker, appearing drunk on whiskey while actually drinking iced tea.  Another local aristocrat, Angela Barr, wins the highly competitive bidding for Banning's team over the President's daughter.  The president knew of Banning's background and had his daughter bid for him for what he was sure would be the winning team.Before play proceeds, Chris Patton tells the organizing committee that Banning is a former pro. Banning ends up giving up his handicap of 5 to play at scratch.  He is informed that Patton provided this information and gets into a fight with him, almost killing him.  Patton withdraws from the tournament and is replaced by Linus, now playing with his father-in-law, J. Pallister Young.The tournament comes down to a sudden-death playoff, just as had happened in the ill-fated attempt to bribe Banning on the tour.  On the 17th hole, with a life-saving shot, Banning makes a near impossible shot over a tall stand of trees.\",\n",

       " 'Caddyshack': 'Danny Noonan (Michael O\\'Keefe) works as a caddie at the exclusive Bushwood Country Club to earn enough money to go to college. Danny caddies for Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a mischievous but avid golfer and the son of one of Bushwood\\'s co-founders. Danny tries to gain favor with Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the country club\\'s arrogant co-founder and director of the caddie scholarship program, by caddying for him. Meanwhile, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), a mentally unstable groundskeeper who lives in the maintenance building, is sent by his Scottish supervisor Sandy McFiddish (Thomas A. Carlin) to hunt a gopher that is damaging the course. He attempts to kill it with a rifle and high-pressure hose but fails.Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a loud and free-spirited nouveau riche golfer, begins attending the club. Czervik distracts Smails as he tees off, causing his shot to go badly. Later, frustrated by slow play, Czervik wagers with Smails. Smails is furious for losing the bet and throws his putter, injuring an elderly woman. Danny takes the blame for the incident to gain Smails\\' favor. Smails encourages him to apply for the caddie scholarship.At Bushwood\\'s annual Fourth of July banquet, Danny and his girlfriend Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) work as waiting staff. Czervik continues to annoy Smails and the club members, while Danny becomes attracted to Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), Smails\\' promiscuous niece.Later, Danny wins the Caddy Day golf tournament and the scholarship, earning him an invitation from Smails to attend the christening ceremony for his boat. The boat is sunk at the event after an accident involving Czervik\\'s larger boat. Returning home, Smails discovers Lacey and Danny in bed at his house. Expecting to be fired or to have the scholarship revoked, Danny is surprised when Smails only demands that he keep the incident secret.Unable to bear the continued presence of the uncouth Czervik, Smails confronts him and announces that he will never be granted membership. Czervik counters by announcing that he would never consider being a member: he insults the country club and claims to be there merely to evaluate buying it and developing the land into condominiums. After a brief fight and exchange of insults, Webb suggests they discuss the situation over drinks. After Smails demands satisfaction, Czervik proposes a team golf match with Smails and his regular golfing partner Dr. Beeper (Dan Resin) against Czervik and Webb. Against club rules, they also agree to a $20,000 wager on the match, which quickly doubles to $40,000. That evening, Webb practices for the game against Smails and his errant shot brings him to meet Carl; the two share a bottle of wine and a joint.The match is held the next day. Word spreads of the stakes involved, drawing in a crowd. During the game, Smails and Beeper take the lead, while Czervik, to his chagrin, is \"playing the worst game of his life\" while at the same time Webb slowly cracks over his own awful game. Czervik reacts to Smails\\' wisecracks by angrily doubling the wager to $80,000 per team. When his own ricocheting ball strikes his arm, Czervik fakes an injury in hopes of having the contest declared a draw. Lou (Brian Doyle-Murray), the caddy manager who is acting as an umpire, tells Czervik his team will forfeit unless they find a substitute. When Webb chooses Danny, Smails threatens to revoke his scholarship, but Czervik promises Danny that he will make it \"worth his while\" if he wins. Danny chooses to play.Upon reaching the final hole, the score is tied. Judge Smails scores a birdie. Danny has to complete a difficult putt to win. Czervik again doubles the wager based on Danny making the putt. Danny\\'s putt leaves the ball hanging over the edge of the hole. At that moment, in his latest attempt to kill the gopher, Carl detonates plastic explosives that he has rigged around the golf course. Several explosions shake the ground and cause the ball to drop into the hole, handing Danny, Webb and Czervik victory on the wager. Smails refuses to pay, so Czervik beckons two intimidating men (Moose and Rocco) to \"help the judge find his checkbook.\" As Smails is chased across the course, Czervik leads a wild party at the clubhouse, attended by all of the onlookers at the match. Some distance away, the gopher emerges from underground, unharmed, and dances to the film\\'s main theme, \"I\\'m Alright\", amid the smoldering ruins of the golf course.',\n",

Despite Jack's poor performance early in the match, with luck he ties the match before the final hole. However, during the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt, while Chandler faces a simple two-foot putt. Using advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy two-foot putt to tie the match.

Anxious about his reception, he is warmly welcomed by many spectators, some of whom have closed their local shops for the day to watch him play.The scene changes to Atlanta, Georgia, where Jones, a young boy, observes his father \"Colonel\" Jones playing golf, poorly. The more young Bobby watches, the more he emulates the better players he sees, such as Stewart Maiden, a club professional originally from Scotland. By the time he is 14, Jones wins the 1916 Georgia State Amateur Championship and makes the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur that same year. Notable sportswriters of the era such as O.B. Keeler and Grantland Rice take a keen interest in him.With World War I coming to an end, Jones participates in war-relief matches with several famous golfers such as the colorful Walter Hagen, who eventually becomes Bobby\\'s chief rival on the course. He also attends Georgia Tech, where he receives a diploma and meets Mary Malone, whom he ultimately marries. Despite his great skill as a golfer, he also has a hot temper that affects his game and reputation. His first time at St. Andrews, in 1921, Jones walks off the course after 11 holes of the third round, expressing his dislike for the course. His idol Harry Vardon, who would win The Open Championship six times during his career, cautions Bobby never to quit, particularly at St. Andrews, which he considers the greatest golf course of all.In 1923, Jones finally overcomes his temper troubles and wins his first major championship at the U.S. Open, defeating Bobby Cruickshank in a playoff. In the following years, great success follows as Bobby wins 2 more U.S. Opens, 4 U.S. Amateurs, and 2 Open Championships through 1929. During that timeframe, Jones attends Harvard College and later Emory University School of Law, becoming a lawyer by profession (which was his grandfather\\'s wish), never turning professional as a golfer. By 1930, Jones begins to lose interest in tournament golf. He tells Mary his final goal is to win all 4 majors in the same year and will then retire. That year, Jones accomplishes that goal, becoming the first and still only golfer to win the calendar Grand Slam. Soon after, Bobby keeps his word and he shocks the sports world by retiring from tournament golf at only 28 years old.A title card reveals that after retirement, Jones would continue to make contributions to the game of golf such as founding the Augusta National Golf Club and The Masters. He served in the United States Air Forces during World War II. In 1948, Jones was diagnosed with syringomyelia which crippled him for the rest of his life until his death in 1971.',\n",
       " 'The Greatest Game Ever Played': 'Set mainly in 1913, the film is about Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), the first amateur to win the U.S. Open. Amateur golf in that era was a sport only for the wealthy, and Ouimet came from an Irish and French-Canadian immigrant family that was part of the working class. Ouimet watches an exhibition by legendary British golf pro Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a caddie at The Country Club, a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts, while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship.One day, a Club member, Mr. Hastings (Justin Ashforth), asks Ouimet to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the U.S. Amateur, the local qualifying for which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur (Elias Koteas) tells his son to quit golf and get a \"real job\". Ouimet needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he could not qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Ouimet is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper.With much jeer from the rich folk, Ouimet, now 20, fulfills his promise to his dad and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Ouimet is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the United States Golf Association enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Ouimet secures entry. His father informs Ouimet that he must find his own place to live after the tournament and Ouimet agrees to this arrangement. However, his mother has been supportive of his golf from the start. She admonishes Ouimet\\'s father for not recognizing Ouimet\\'s talent and that he now has a chance to demonstrate it in an important tournament.Ouimet competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, the familiar course located across the street from his home. The favorites are British champions Vardon and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus), who are accompanied by the snobbish Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth), and the reigning U.S. Open champion, John McDermott. Northcliffe looks to see that either Vardon or Ray wins the Open, to affirm British dominance over the Americans in golf, and also to prove that only gentlemen were able champions. Ouimet competes with his 10-year old friend, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter), who skips school to caddie for Ouimet. After the first two rounds, Vardon and Ray have a seemingly comfortable lead, with McDermott unable to keep up. After some initial struggles, Ouimet rallies back and ends up tying with Vardon and Ray at the end of the fourth round, meaning that the three of them would compete in an 18-hole playoff to determine the champion. The night before, Northcliffe mocks Ouimet\\'s social status to Vardon, who came from humble beginnings himself, and Vardon finally tells Northcliffe that he is going to try to win only for his own pride, not Britain\\'s and that if Ouimet wins, it will be because of his own skill, not his background.The playoff round commences, with all three competitors keeping it close until the final holes, where Ray fades out, and Ouimet ahead of Vardon by a stroke going into the final hole. Vardon finishes with a par, giving Ouimet the chance to clinch the win with a par himself. Seeing him become nervous before the final putt, Eddie calms him down, and Ouimet is able to make the putt and win the U.S. Open. As the crowd carries him and Eddie on their shoulders, they start to hand him money. Ouimet refuses it all, only accepting one bill from his now proud father. In the clubhouse, Vardon privately congratulates Ouimet and suggests that they should play a friendly round together in the future. Ouimet and Eddie then walk home, carrying the U.S. Open trophy.',\n",

Tatara) and Jason Jones (Jerad Anderson), who both focus more on pursuing college girls.  Also at the party is Tyler\\'s sister, Mandy (Sandy Modic) who almost shares an intimate moment with Keller before being chased off by Tyler, who doesn\\'t approve of a relationship between the two because of Keller\\'s lifestyle.  After Mandy leaves the party, Keller is talked into having sex with a random student at the party; Keller is caught when Mark secretly records them together and plays the tape at Tyler\\'s PAHR shop the next day, hurting Mandy in the process.Keller is talked into taking on the same two anonymous men spying on him the previous day, who are revealed to be plastic surgeons Dr. Carlton (Dean Cameron) and Dr. Hamilton (Christopher Showerman) from their own company NuBoobs.  Keller signs an agreement that if he wins, he\\'ll get $50,000, but if the surgeons win, Keller becomes a test patient for any projects they have in mind.  It\\'s soon discovered that the same guy helping Keller hustle people on the course has now appeared to help these two surgeons hustle Keller instead.  After Keller loses, he attempts to bail on the surgeons but gets tased unconscious.  Keller wakes up the next morning in his own home only to discover he\\'s been given breast implants overnight by the surgeons.Along with Tyler, Keller visits the surgeons demanding the operation to be reversed, but they\\'ll only do it for $50,000 and give Keller two weeks to get said money or else they mail his post-surgery pictures out to his family and friends.  Tyler attempts to get rapper Darius \"Ice Pyk\" Vernon to sponsor PAHR, but he brings Mark to the meeting, whose dialogue gets both of them kicked out of Ice Pyk\\'s building.  Convinced by Tyler to do so, Keller heads back to the golf course and begins winning rounds of golf for money against various people, eventually becoming comfortable in golfing with implants.  During these series of events, Keller is pursued by a repo man (Dean Cain) who is constantly trying to collect Keller\\'s mustang that he\\'s behind with payments on; the repo man eventually succeeds, but immediately wrecks the vehicle after the brakes were cut by Mark, who was only attempting to repair them.Together, Keller and Tyler earn $42,000 in two weeks, just falling eight grand short of the surgeons\\' demands.  Keller makes one more offer to the surgeons, stating that if he and Tyler can beat them, the surgeons reverse the operation free of charge, but if the surgeons win, Tyler gives up PAHR to them.  During the match, Keller struggles until Mandy shows up with Keller\\'s father.  It was revealed that the surgeons went back on their word and mailed Keller\\'s post-surgery pics to his father.  Mandy forgives Keller for his actions, and his father convinces Keller to pursue a career in golf after seeing how much money he had won in two weeks.  This is enough for Keller to get his groove back and win the match by one stroke over the surgeons.The surgeons declare that they won\\'t reverse the surgery despite losing, but are soon chased down by Ice Pyk\\'s bodyguards, while Ice Pyk himself agrees to work with PAHR, much to Tyler\\'s delight.  The movie ends with commercials for PAHR Golf and NuBoobs.',\n",

She meets her new boss, Kendrick Paulsen, who reveals the school is creating a men's golf team. Starks asks to be the team's coach and Paulsen agrees. However, Starks is angry when she learns Paulsen is giving the golf team very little funding, and even has to fight him just to get enough money to offer scholarships to players.Starks attempts to recruit African-American golf players for the team, but is only able to get Craig, a talented former caddy, for the team. When she learns the school's soccer team has recruited German players, Starks goes international as well and recruits four young men from all over the world - Edward from London, Ji-Kyung (nicknamed Young Ji) from South Korea, Cameron from Australia, and Bassam from Algeria. The team begins training and things are immediately difficult. Edward and Ji-Kyung act disrespectfully to Starks, especially after learning she has never coached a golf team before, Bassam is temperamental and has a constant bad attitude, and Craig's lack of confidence causes his game to suffer when playing in front of his teammates or a crowd. Edward develops a crush on Stacey, a medical student who is a former member of Starks's swim team.The team play their first tournament and it is disastrous, and they come in dead last. Starks confronts the team about their poor teamwork and encourages them to give the game their all so they can win the upcoming Minority Championships, and begins helping Craig overcome his confidence issues. Stacey goes to Starks to ask for advice on her relationship with Edward, but Starks warns Stacey not to get involved with Edward. The team attends a party at a fraternity, where Stacey breaks up with Edward, who is upset to learn that Starks told her to do so. Bassam gets into a fight with two fraternity members, and as the men are leaving Cameron becomes furious that his actions could get them kicked off the team and shoves Bassam to the ground, reminding the group that golf is all they have. Paulsen meets with Starks to discuss the fight, and when Starks refuses to kick Bassam off the team without getting all the facts, Paulsen fires her due to his dislike of her constantly challenging him.That night, Edward confronts Starks about Stacey and says she has no meaning in her life, causing her to break down in tears as she realizes just how much the team means to her. Starks speaks to each team member individually and connects with them. While speaking to Edward, she reveals that she once had a boyfriend who proposed to her just before he left to compete in a professional golf tournament, but Starks turned him down when he wanted her to choose between him or her own education and career. Starks explains she didn't want Stacey to experience the same thing. Starks invites the team to her house for dinner, where she reveals she has lost her job, but promises to help them win the championship. The team begin to bond and their performance at tournaments improves dramatically. During a meeting of the athletics board, Paulsen reveals he fired Starks, angering the rest of the members. Paulsen becomes overwhelmed with anger at getting no respect due to his wealthy upbringing, until Roger, a janitor and Paulsen's former football teammate, tells Paulsen that he needs to give respect to those who have earned it if he wants to get any respect himself.At the Minority Championships, Craig competes in the first round and chokes after he is bullied by a member of a prestigious golf team. At dinner, Cameron accidentally eats shellfish and suffers a severe allergic reaction, meaning he cannot compete in the rest of the championship. Starks makes the four remaining team members how important it is for them to prove to the other schools that they have what it takes. The team supports Craig, and his confidence is boosted enough that he soon gets into the lead. When the rival golfer is putting, Edward distracts him using a technique he learned from Cameron, and he misses the shot. As a result, the Tennessee State University men's golf team comes in first place, impressing Paulsen enough that he agrees to let Starks keep her job and remain the coach.\",\n",

       " 'Stick It': 'Haley Graham (Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who has a run-in with the law when she and two friends go biking through a residential construction site in Plano, Texas. Haley is arrested and forced by a judge to return to the regimented world of competitive gymnastics.Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the U.S. One year earlier, she made it to the World Championships, but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics, if not the most hated.Haley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy (VGA) in Houston, her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Bridges). Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again, at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport\\'s rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts—as well as her past—causes conflicts.At the invitational, Haley\\'s talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons why she retired to begin with: the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley says, \"It doesn\\'t matter how well you do. It\\'s how well you follow their rules.\"In addition, Haley is severely stressed by her domineering mother, Alice (Gia Carides), who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship (\"Worlds\") has not been forgotten by the other athletes and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships a year earlier, leaves the arena before completing the competition. However, before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason why she walked out of Worlds, singlehandedly costing the American team the gold medal in the process: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her previous coach and her parents got divorced as a result.Haley then goes back to the judge who sentenced her to the gymnastics academy to inform her that she has dropped out and wants to be sent to either a juvenile hall or military academy, but the judge tells Haley that someone (obviously Vickerman) had just paid off all of her debt for the property damages in her incident with the law, meaning she is no longer under any legal issues and having jerks for parents doesn\\'t need to ruin her life.Haley then approaches Vickerman, who confirms it by claiming that he used the money that her father had paid him for her gymnastics training. Vickerman persuades Haley to remain with the academy a while longer so she can continue with her training to reach Nationals. Although she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina Hoyt (Maddy Curley), Wei Wei Yong (Nikki SooHoo) and Joanne Charis (Lengies), qualifies for the National Championships.The biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, vault, Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score (9.5 out of 10). When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was penalized on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up. However, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust (otherwise known as a \"scratch\"). One by one, the other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway.Haley\\'s bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk among themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they, by consensus, deem the best to be the \"winner\".The winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch. It seems the movement will be ruined when Tricia Skilken (Tarah Paige), a longtime judges\\' favorite and Haley\\'s former teammate and best friend, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself, but Tricia ends up joining the movement and scratches in the last event as well. What started out as a gymnastics competition turns into a small revolution for the rules and Haley, whose talents are recognized once more and her future seems to be set with numerous colleges offering her athletic scholarships to compete in NCAA gymnastics.',\n",
       " 'Peaceful Warrior': 'Dan Millman is a university student as well as a locally famous gymnast who dreams of winning a National Championship competition. He suffers from restlessness, and on one occasion, Dan attempts to compensate for the restlessness by running along streets before sunrise. At a car-service station, he encounters an old man who seems to know more about Dan\\'s problem than Dan himself knows, whom Dan later nicknames \"Socrates\". Dan is unsettled by Socrates\\' knowledge; by the fact that Socrates had appeared in a nightmare as a faceless janitor, clad in mismatched shoes (by which he is identified in waking life), who sweeps up the pieces of Dan\\'s shattered leg; and by the old man\\'s extraordinary speed, agility, and coordination. As a result of his exposure to the last, Dan seeks to learn the secret behind it.Socrates, prodded by the impatient and defiant Dan, gives the boy a series of tasks and lessons. The central concept of \"Soc\\'s\" philosophy is this: that one must live entirely in the present moment. Other ideas include the related notion that at no time is \"nothing going on\" and the idea that an appropriate time exists for fighting and another for abstaining from violence. These lessons are conveyed through practical lessons, long contemplation, and one spectacular mystical experience. Dan gradually learns to appreciate every moment; to view the journey toward a goal as more meaningful and significant than the attainment; to pay attention to that which he is doing – thus increasing his gymnastic prowess; and (to a slightly lesser extent) control himself. Throughout the lesson, Dan learns virtually nothing about his mentor, other than the philosophy, Socrates\\' belief that service is the most noble action possible (hence his choice to work as a car serviceman), and the presence of another protégé.This protégé, a woman of Dan\\'s own age named Joy, has learned and integrated Socrates\\' philosophy into her life, to the extent that she seems as wise as Socrates himself. Dan attempts to ask her for information regarding Socrates, but receives little. Joy treats Dan indulgently, though she evidently respects him.One day, Dan drives recklessly, and his motorcycle collides with a car that ran a red light, causing his right femur bone to shatter. He is rushed to a hospital, where a metal bar is placed in his leg to maintain its integrity. As a result, his gymnastic coach believes that Dan cannot compete in the National competition. Dan, hurt by this lack of faith, recovers from the injury and resumes his training under Socrates\\' tutelage. Eventually, he is restored to full health and strength, while his coordination improves and his mind is set entirely on the present moment. He competes in the U.S. Trials for the Olympics and achieves a victory.Slightly before the competition, Dan diverts the bus he is riding to Socrates\\' station, only to find that Socrates has vanished without a trace. At the arena, he attempts to teach his teammate Tommy what he has learned, but fails due to Tommy\\'s emotional insecurity and lack of comprehension. Dan then is called upon for his turn to perform on the still rings. While he does his routine, Dan performs flawlessly just like Pommel Horse tryouts. Moments before he completes his routine, Socrates is in his thoughts asking him three questions: \"Where are you, Dan?\" \"Here.\" \"What time is it?\" \"Now.\" \"What are You?\" \"This Moment.\" Dan then performs triple consecutive flips, with the commentators frantically speaking and the judges staring at him in amazement. He then dismounts, and the rings swing outwards, eventually touching each other. The screen goes black, leaving his last moment unknown.The postscript states that Dan and his Berkeley Gymnastics Team won their first National title. It is implied at the end, in a postscript appearing on screen, that Dan of the film and Dan the author of the book on which the film is based are one and the same. It is also stated that the latter Dan lives with his wife Joy.',\n",

She comes to the very end of her practice and decides to disobey the coach by doing the back handspring dismount, but falls and breaks her ankle. When McKenna comes home, she is very angry, as her parents say that the accident will allow her to focus on school now instead of gymnastics. McKenna yells at them saying they must be happy she broke her ankle as she would have nothing to do, but study, and hobbles into her room. She tears down most of her posters about the Olympics, and cries.McKenna keeps meeting with Josie, and is soon found out by Toulane. Toulane is very upset that McKenna lied to her.

Afterwards, Josie invites McKenna to go the horseback riding facility for kids with disabilities where Josie rides. McKenna first agrees, but then remembers she gets her cast off the same day and tells Josie she can\\'t go after all, which upsets Josie. McKenna later realizes that she should go and does so, only to run into Toulane. Toulane says that McKenna showed Josie their secret handshake on their camping trip.

Meanwhile, Toulane is upset and finally admits to McKenna that she\\'s sick of competitive gymnastics; her mother has been pushing her into it so that Toulane can follow in the footsteps of her older sister, a star gymnast, and Toulane no longer enjoys it. She tells McKenna that she has been watching the rhythmic gymnastics practices and wishes she could do that instead.During the meet, McKenna hesitates on her beam dismount, but after seeing Josie in the audience, she goes for it and sticks the landing. She and Toulane are both named to the regional competitive team, but Toulane finally confronts her mother, and is finally allowed to switch to rhythmic gymnastics, and her place on the competitive team goes to the much-improved Sierra.

He befriends hikers Kristi and Megan, and shows them an underground pool before they head home. After that, Aron continues on through a slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon. While climbing, he loses grip and falls, knocking a boulder which traps his right arm against the wall. Aron attempts to move the boulder but it won't budge; he also soon realizes he is alone. He shortly begins recording a video diary using his camcorder to maintain morale, as he chips away parts of the boulder with a pocket knife. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night, and is forced to drink his urine when his water runs out. He also sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder.Throughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed, and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana.  During one hallucination, Aron realizes that his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long. On the sixth day, Aron has a vision of his future son, spurring his will to survive. He fashions a tourniquet from CamelBak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it. Then, using his knowledge of torque, he breaks the bones in his arm and, using the multi-tool, slowly amputates it.

       " 'Best of the Best (1989 film)': 'Alexander Grady, a widower and father from Portland, Oregon is chosen to represent the United States of America in an international martial arts tournament against Team Korea. Once a rising star in the martial arts world, he suffered a shoulder injury that forced him into retirement. Also chosen for the team are Tommy Lee, a highly skilled martial arts instructor from Fresno, California; Travis Brickley, an extremely brash fighter with a short fuse from Miami, Florida; Virgil Keller, a devout Buddhist from Providence, Rhode Island; and Sonny Grasso, a streetwise fighter from Detroit, Michigan. Despite being coached by veteran trainer Frank Couzo, their chances of winning are virtually non-existent, as the Koreans train all year long, enjoy lucrative financial support from their nation, and have—on at least one occasion—killed a competitor in the ring. To win, they will need to be the best technically, physically, and mentally.As training begins, the team struggles to bond as Travis antagonizes them. Given the pressure, the American team hires a second assistant coach, Catherine Wade, whose spiritual approach to training clashes with Couzo\\'s more rigorous coaching techniques. Tommy is disturbed when his opponent is revealed to be Dae Han Park, Team Korea\\'s best fighter and veteran martial artist who was responsible for killing Tommy\\'s brother David Lee in a similar tournament. Couzo hopes that Tommy\\'s desire for revenge will give him the necessary aggression to win, while Wade is more concerned about Tommy\\'s mental state. With time and training, the team begins to bond and to earn each other\\'s respect.Couzo cuts Alex from the team when he breaks the rigid training regimen to visit his son, who had been hit by a car; later, Tommy quits after knocking out Virgil with a powerful spinning side kick during practice. Travis and the others persuade Couzo to reinstate Alex, and Tommy eventually rejoins the team after a change of heart.In the first two matches of the tournament, Sonny and Virgil are out-classed by their Korean opponents Yung Kim and Han Cho. Travis does his best to psyche up the team with his brash attitude, going point for point with his Korean counterpart Tung Sung Moon, but gets beaten in a tie-breaker brick-breaking competition. Alex dominates his match with his opponent, Sae Jin Kwon, but takes a devastating axe-kick to his shoulder which dislocates it. Instead of giving up, he implores Tommy to \"pop\" the shoulder back into place and resumes the fight, ultimately defeating his opponent with one arm and winning the match. Finally, Tommy faces Dae Han. After a slow start, Tommy gets the upper hand and delivers a series of blows that forces Dae Han solely on the defensive. As the match nears its end, Tommy has brought the American team within two points of outright victory, and Dae Han can barely stand. Tommy prepares to finish the fight, but knowing that Dae Han would not survive the attack, his coaches and teammates dissuade him. Tommy hesitates and lets the clock run out, saving the man\\'s life but forfeiting the overall victory. Couzo consoles Tommy afterwards, telling him, \"You won that match. Don\\'t ever forget that\".At the medal ceremony, Dae Han unexpectedly approaches Tommy and praises him for his honorable act. He tearfully apologizes for the death of Tommy\\'s brother, and in return offers himself as a brother. Tommy accepts, and Dae Han places his medal around Tommy\\'s neck before the two men embrace. Sae Jin Kwon then walks up to Alex and states his long-time admiration for him as a fighter, before also handing over his medal. The other members of Team Korea then follow suit, awarding their medals to their respective American opponents.',\n",

Xian\\'s dog Kiki is also stabbed while trying to protect Eric. As Taylor prepares to take Kiki to town for treatment, Mylee confesses to him about her rape and reveals she has not told Kurt, insisting that his mind must be clear for the fight with Tong Po.

Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry\\'s endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry\\'s hero worship of Norris, and from that at least some of Barry\\'s daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry\\'s training, devising training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.Lee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest, and at Lee\\'s urging, Chan convinces Norris to join the team.

Barry is stunned to find himself working together with his hero.The tournament involves four events: Breaking, Men\\'s Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone\\'s team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone\\'s students, in Breaking.

Faced with a much more heroic-seeming task, Barry wins.After the tournament, Barry is seen talking to Norris, thanking him for his help. Norris vanishes, and it is implied that Barry has found the strength to live his life without the need for his daydreams.

A final competitor is Helena Douglas, daughter of the tournament\\'s late founder. When they arrive, they are monitored by the island\\'s supervisor, Dr. Victor Donovan, who, aided by egghead Weatherby, is gathering data (using injected nano-sensors) from the fights for some mysterious project. To add to the situation, an assassin from Kasumi\\'s colony, named Ayane, has followed Kasumi to kill her and wipe away the disgrace the princess has caused to the clan.The contest plays out, with multiple contestants fighting and being defeated (including Gen Fu, Bayman, Leon, and Zack), until only Kasumi, Christie, Hayabusa and Tina are left, with Helena being defeated by Christie. During the course of the film, Max and Christie form a plan to steal the fortune stowed away inside a hidden vault.

Off-duty police officer Joe Collins (Max Martini), who was receiving a private lesson from Mike, sees that Laura is distressed and tries to take her coat. Startled, Laura grabs Joe's gun and it goes off, shattering the studio's front window. To avoid having Laura charged with attempted murder, Mike and Joe agree to conceal the event.Mike's insurance, however, will not cover his act of God claim that the window was broken by a strong wind. Mike's wife Sondra (Alice Braga), whose fashion business profits are the only thing keeping the struggling studio afloat, requests that Mike ask for a loan from her brother Ricardo (John Machado), a mixed martial arts champion. At Ricardo's nightclub, Mike meets with Sondra's other brother, Bruno (Rodrigo Santoro), and learns that Joe quit as the club's bouncer because Bruno never paid him. Mike confronts Bruno about the situation but is rebuffed. Mike then declines Bruno's offer to fight on the undercard of an upcoming match between Ricardo and Japanese legend Morisaki (Enson Inoue), which could potentially pay out $50,000. Mike believes all competitions are not honorable and weaken the fighter.Meanwhile, aging Hollywood action star Chet Frank (Tim Allen) enters the nightclub without security and is accosted by a man with a broken bottle. Mike intervenes and subdues three men in the process. The following day, Mike receives an expensive watch and an invitation to dinner from Chet. Mike gives the watch to Joe to pawn in lieu of his unpaid salary at the nightclub. At the dinner party, Chet's wife Zena (Rebecca Pidgeon) arranges an informal business deal to buy a large number of dresses from Sondra's company. Chet, impressed by Mike, invites him to the set of his current film. As Mike and Sondra leave the dinner, Mike explains his unique training method to Chet's business associate Jerry Weiss (Joe Mantegna). Before a sparring match, each fighter must draw one of three marbles, two white and one black; whoever draws a black marble has to fight with a handicap.Mike uses his military experience to answer a few technical questions for Chet on the film set and is offered the role of co-producer. That evening, Mike faxes the details of his training methods to Jerry so they can be used in the film. Joe arrives at the studio and informs Mike that he was suspended from duty for pawning the watch, which turned out to be stolen. During their dinner that evening, Mike relays the information to Jerry who excuses himself to handle the matter, but never returns. At home, Mike learns that the phone numbers that Zena gave Sondra have been disconnected. Sondra is panicky, having borrowed $30,000 from a loan shark to order the fabric for the dresses. As he meets with the loan shark to discuss an extension, Mike notices Bruno and Marty Brown (Ricky Jay) on television using Mike's marble-drawing method as a promotional gimmick for the undercard fights of Ricardo's match.Mike hires Laura to sue, but Marty's lawyer threatens that if they do not drop the lawsuit, he will give the police an empty shell casing with Laura's fingerprints, as proof that she attempted to kill an off-duty cop. He also threatens Mike as a witness who covered up the crime by bribing the cop with a stolen watch. When told of the situation, Joe feels responsible and kills himself. Mike feels obligated to help Joe's financially struggling wife and, in desperate need of money himself, decides to compete as an undercard fighter in the upcoming competition.At the arena, Mike discovers the fights are being fixed via a magician (Cyril Takayama) using sleight of hand to surreptitiously switch the white and black marbles. Disgusted by this revelation, Mike confronts the conspirators: Marty, Jerry and Bruno who confirm that unknown to the competitors, the fights are handicapped by the fight promoters so as to ensure winning bets. They also reveal that Ricardo is intentionally losing the fight to Morisaki so they can make money on the rematch. Jerry tells Mike that Sondra is the one who told them about Laura shooting the window and Bruno justifies her betrayal by explaining that his sister is too smart to stay with someone who cannot provide for her.As Mike is exiting the arena, he meets Laura. Their conversation is not audible, but it ends with Laura slapping Mike. Mike then re-enters the arena. He incapacitates several security guards trying to stop him and is ultimately engaged by Ricardo. The audience and camera crews take notice as Mike and Ricardo face off in the arena's corridors. Inspired by the Professor (Dan Inosanto), an elderly martial arts master attending the match, Mike manages to slip a difficult choke hold and defeats Ricardo, making it onto the ring to speak to the Professor personally. He is approached by Morisaki, who offers Mike his ivory-studded belt, previously referred to as a Japanese national treasure, as a sign of respect. He is then approached by the Professor himself, who proceeds to award the coveted red belt to an incredulous Mike, and embraces him, acknowledging his dedication to the art.\",\n",

One day, a troublemaker Yuan, while retrieving his kite, witnesses Ip defeating fellow kung fu Master Liu in a friendly sparring match. While spreading the news, his brother Lin, a restaurant owner and disciple of Liu, embarrasses Yuan as he tries to arrange a rematch between Liu and Ip. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ip and his family are forced to move into a decrepit apartment as the Imperial Japanese Army confiscates the house for their military headquarters. Desperate to support his family, Ip works at a coal mine alongside Lin, who hopes to reconcile with his brother for humiliating him but fails to track him down.

Former police officer Li Zhao, now an interpreter for the Japanese, offers the martial artists to fight in the arena. Ip at first declines to participate but when Lin goes missing, he agrees to join and investigate.At the arena, Ip witnesses Liu being mercilessly executed by Miura's deputy Colonel Sato, for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after giving up a second match against 3 karatekas. Deducing that Lin was killed in his fight against Miura, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once, whom he brutally defeats. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who seeks to see Ip fight again.

One night, after watching a match involving local champion Hammerman, Bone makes a deal with promoter Pinball to get him into the fight scene for 20% of his earnings; 40% if Pinball puts his own money on the line. On that same night, Bone encounters mob boss James and his girlfriend Angela Soto. Bone enters his first underground fight and quickly defeats his opponent with only two kicks. Pinball explains to Bone that Angela was previously married, but James set up her husband Danny on a triple-homicide, sending him to jail. When James learned that she was pregnant, he had her undergo an abortion. Since then, Angela has fallen into drug addiction.Over the next few nights, Bone makes a name for himself in the underground fighting scene, defeating every fighter in his path and earning himself and Pinball thousands in cash. At the same time, he bonds with the people who live at his apartment building: Tamara - the landlady who manages his apartment, Roberto - an elderly Latin-American man whom he plays chess with, and Jared - a young boy Tamara adopted after his father was sent to prison. Then, after making the once-undefeated Hammerman fall to the ground, Bone is offered a deal by James. The international underground fighting scene is run by a league of rich, powerful men known as the \"Consortium\", but mainly by a black market arms dealer named Franklin McVeigh, and James wants Bone to square off against Pretty Boy Price, the reigning champion. \\nAfter telling James he will consider the offer, Bone reveals to Angela that he was cell mates and close friends with Danny. Then one day, Danny was murdered by an inmate named JC.

Bone promises to bring her to her son, but sends her to a drug rehab clinic until she is ready.The next morning, James offers McVeigh US$5 million to have him get the Consortium approve and schedule a fight between Bone and Price. That night, Bone discovers that Roberto has been murdered in front of the apartment, mauled to death by James\\' dogs because he witnessed one of James\\' street killings. Bone declines the offer to fight for James mainly because he never agreed to it; as a result, James orders his thugs to hunt down Bone and Pinball.

Transmitting his location through Teddy D\\'s GPS phone, James has the duo follow him to McVeigh\\'s mansion.

Bone faces Price, but at the point where he is close to defeating him, he taps the ground and forfeits the fight. An infuriated James grabs his katana and attacks Bone, but Bone is thrown a jian by McVeigh\\'s bodyguard to even the odds. Bone drops the sword and uses the sheath instead, beating James with it. In the middle of the melee, Bone redirects a sword slash, causing James to cut off his own hand. He runs off before the police arrive at the mansion to arrest James.The next day, Angela is reunited with Jared. Tamara, who had threatened to kick Bone out due to his association with James, offers him to stay; he declines, saying he will only cause further trouble.

In order to placate the masses, the corporation\\'s Chairman, Heihachi Mishima, sponsors the King of Iron Fist Tournament, or Iron Fist - in which fighters from the 8 corporations battle until one is left standing and receives a lifetime of stardom and wealth. In contrast to the rich and lush Tekken City, there is the slum area surrounding it, referred to as the Anvil.Jin Kazama has been raised by his mother, Jun, She has trained him in martial arts and has been a mentor, yet she never speaks of Jin\\'s father, claiming he is dead. In 2039, Jin is now a rebellious 19-year-old teenage fighter and contraband runner who lives in the Anvil, and usually goes into fights and cooperates with the resistance groups to earn money to provide food (fruit, coffee and chocolate have become expensive and rare commodities in the Anvil). One night, Jin is targeted by the Jackhammers, the elite specs group that patrols the Anvil and ensures the safety of Tekken City, for cooperating with the resistance groups. He tries to return to his home, only to find his mother, Jun, killed by the Jackhammers bombarding the house.Grieving the loss of his mother and feeling guilty that he had not protected her, Jin swears revenge against Heihachi. In the ruins of his former home, he finds a Tekken Fighter I.D. belonging to Jun, revealing she was once an Iron Fist fighter. Furious about this, he decides to try out at the Open Call, which lets the Anvil pick a fighter for the tournament. After defeating the disgraced Marshall Law, who was dropped out of the Tournament and forced to fight in the Open Call, Jin is sponsored by former boxer Steve Fox, sponsor of the Open Call and former Iron Fist fighter, and is hailed \"The People\\'s Choice\", who takes him to Tekken City.Upon entering Tekken City, Jin befriends mixed martial artist Christie Monteiro. After witnessing Raven overpower Capoeira fighter Eddy Gordo in the first match, Jin wins the match against Miguel Caballero Rojo, nearly killing him in a fit of rage. Heihachi\\'s son, Kazuya Mishima, is impressed and offers Jin a place in Tekken Corp., but Jin refuses. Later that night, after sneaking out with Christie and visiting a nightclub, Jin is attacked by masked assassins, on the orders of Kazuya, who is scheming to take over Tekken and sees Jin as a possible obstacle since he is hailing as People\\'s Choice. Jin survives the assassination attempt, thanks to Christie\\'s interference. Steve and Christie attempt to discourage Jin from continuing in the tournament, but Jin vows to win Iron Fist and kill both Heihachi and Kazuya, and he gives Fox Jun\\'s ID, he realizes he is her son, telling him that he knew her. Meanwhile, Kazuya blackmails the tournament\\'s champion, Bryan Fury, into killing Jin in a match or be exposed as a partial cyborg, banning him from the tournament for life (cyborgs are banned from fighting).During the quarter-finals, Christie is paired with Nina Williams. But before the fight, Jin notices Nina\\'s face, she was one of the assassins. After Christie defeats Nina, Jin is matched up with an elite swordsman named Yoshimitsu. Heihachi, liking this young fighter, deems that this match be reserved for the semi-finals and attempts to change the order, but Kazuya, who controls the Jackhammers, stops him. Kazuya then has Heihachi imprisoned and orders the match to begin, effectively seizing control of Tekken. Jin narrowly defeats Yoshimitsu, thanks to Heihachi tripping a security alert in the arena.Following the match, Kazuya orders all of the fighters to be detained. He tells them that the rules have changed, and so they must now fight to the death. Jin, Christie, and Steve try to escape, along with Raven, leaving Nina & Anna Williams and Sergei Dragunov behind, since they were in a separate cell. Kazuya notices them escaping and brings down some guards, causing a firefight. Steve, Christie, and Raven cover Jin but he walks across Heihachi\\'s cell. Angry, he tries to taunt him, saying he is responsible for killing his mother. However, because Heihachi is their only chance of escaping Tekken, Steve frees Heihachi and joins the group. On the gunfight, Raven is wounded and recaptured, while the others make it out to the Anvil.In the warehouse that Jin uses as protection, Heihachi reveals to Jin the true nature of his origin. 20 years ago, Jun was fighting in the first Iron Fist tournament placed by the Tekken Corporation after the war, and she impressed Kazuya, who raped her, making him Jin\\'s father, and left her for dead. She survived the assault and Heihachi took her out of Tekken City to the Anvil to keep her alive. Heihachi also tells Jin that since he is Heihachi\\'s grandson, he could become the next Chairman. He also states the corporation\\'s true purpose is to restore order to the world, though Jin can\\'t believe what he is being told, believing that the corporation is spreading terror and fear to its residents. Heihachi entrusts Jin with the task of defeating Kazuya. Later on, the group is located by Jackhammers, who kill Steve Fox in a firefight and recapture the rest of the escapees. Before taking them back to Iron Fist, Kazuya orders the Jackhammers to execute Heihachi.Back in Tekken City, Raven comforts a dispirited Jin, saying that he saw what Jin did to Miguel Rojo and reminding him that anger doesn\\'t fuel the soul, but incinerates it. Raven tells Jin that because there are many people depending on him, he can become champion without letting anger take control of his body. In the Finals, Jin is forced to fight against Bryan Fury, who had already killed Sergei Dragunov in a death match, while Kazuya holds Christie in the control room. At first he is outmatched, but remembering his mother\\'s teachings, Jin kills Bryan.Angered about Jin\\'s victory, Kazuya enters the tournament himself, armed with half moon axes, and begins the final match. The weaponless Jin is battered and is about to lose. He is saved, though, when Christie escapes by shooting the Jackhammers guarding her, creating a distraction. This allows Jin to wound and pin Kazuya, who baits Jin by claiming that he remembers how Jun \"put up quite a fight.\" Kazuya taunts him into inheriting the Mishima Curse (Heihachi imprisoned and killed his father and Kazuya presumably murdered Heihachi), but Jin refuses to kill his father, stating that it is not his curse.Christie comes to the stage and declares Jin the new Champion of Tekken. Elated, the crowd both in and outside the arena cheer for him. When Christie asks where he will go, he replies that he will go home to the Anvil, since he doesn\\'t want to run the corporation. He walks out of Tekken City\\'s gate and is saluted by the Jackhammers - symbolizing his new role as CEO of Tekken Corp. In a voiceover, Christie explains that Jin\\'s victory made the Kazama family name synonymous with hope in the Anvil, but that the true legacy of Tekken is only beginning.After the credits, the scene shifts to Kazuya, who walks out of the arena and realizes that he lost control of the Jackhammers, who refuse to salute him. Back at Heihachi\\'s execution, he kneels in front of a Jackhammer, who is holding him at gunpoint. His final words are: \"I am Heihachi Mishima. I...am...Tekken. You will obey.\"  The Jackhammer lowers down his gun and obeys his command.',\n",
       " 'Ip Man 2': 'Wing Chun master Ip Man and his family move to Hong Kong in 1949 after their escape from Japanese-occupied Foshan. In 1950, Ip desires to open a school to propagate his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but he struggles to attract students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day, a young man named Wong Shun Leung appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight, but is easily defeated. A humiliated Wong leaves, only to return later with some friends to gang up on him; Ip easily beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by Ip\\'s skills, Wong and his friends become Ip\\'s first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.Wong is later confronted by some Hung Ga students while posting promotional posters for Ip\\'s school. One of them, Kei, challenges Wong to a fight and loses, but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Fighting their way outside, an outnumbered Ip and Wong are rescued by Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist, former bandit, and once rival of Ip, who comes to their aid with his own gang.The students\\' master and head of the coalition of Hong Kong\\'s martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to attend a special ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong, and Jin are subsequently arrested by Officer Fatso for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso act as reluctant collectors for the martial arts schools (including Hung\\'s) as part of a protection racket headed by Superintendent Wallace, a corrupt officer in the Hong Kong Police Department.Ip attends the ceremony and defeats his first 2 challengers, before striking a draw with the last challenger, Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school on the condition that he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. In response, Hung has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun school and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip\\'s disciples. Ip is thus forced by his landlady to close up and move the school to his home.Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames him for the recent events since he refused to pay protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung\\'s management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and also insists they finish their fight. During this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son when he suddenly appears, and also suggests that Hung spend more time with his family by having dinner with them as it is more important than settling the duel, earning Hung\\'s respect as a result. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.The boxing competition allows for a demonstration by the various martial arts schools to help promote themselves and their Chinese culture. However, the event\\'s star boxer, Taylor \"The Twister\" Miller, openly insults and attacks the students, causing a brawl that the masters try to quell. Twister challenges Hung to a fight, saying that he will apologize to the Chinese for his racist behavior if Hung can beat him in a fight, with Twister using only boxing while Hung uses Chinese kung fu. Hung accepts the challenge. During the match, it becomes obvious that Twister is a formidable fighter, as his boxing is highly skilled against Hung\\'s kung fu. Many of Hung\\'s blows have little impact on Twister, while Twister\\'s punches are very strong. Hung puts up a valiant fight, but is eventually hindered by his asthma. Ip Man tries to persuade Hung to concede the fight, but Hung refuses to allow Twister to get away with insulting Chinese martial arts. Hung is eventually beaten to death against the ropes.News of Hung\\'s death rapidly spreads throughout the city, enraging the Chinese populace. Wallace arrests and tortures Leung Kan for publishing the news but Fatso saves him and releases him with no charges. A conference was held the following day where Wallace falsely claimed that it was Hung\\'s fault on why the fight happened and how it resulted to his death. Twister announces that in order to clear his name he will accept any challenge from the Chinese to participate in a fair, public boxing match, but arrogantly boasts that he could kill every Chinese boxer in Hong Kong and doubts any of the Chinese are brave enough to face him. Ip arrives and challenges Twister to a fight while Fatso and the press secretly plots against Wallace.As his wife goes into labor, Ip finishes training and begins his fight with Twister. Although Ip struggles at the beginning, he later successfully uses more diverse Wing Chung techniques and great speed against Twister\\'s boxing. However, Twister still proves to be a tough opponent, as many of Ip\\'s blows fail to hurt him. During the match, the tournament\\'s Western organizers attempt to rig the match in favor of Twister, first by ringing the bell at arbitrary times, and then later the judges prohibit Ip from kicking. Through some flashbacks, inspired by Hung\\'s patriotic spirit, Ip regains himself and changes his strategy by attacking Twister\\'s arms to weaken him, ultimately defeating him. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace is arrested by his superiors for corruption and abuse of power after Fatso secretly reports him.Ip gives a speech to the audience, stating that despite the differences between their race and culture, he wishes for everyone to respect each other regardless of their individual status. Both the Western and Chinese audience give him a standing ovation, while Twister\\'s manager disproves, stands up & leaves without a word shaking his head all the way. Ip goes home and reunites with his family, meeting his newborn son, Ip Ching. Ip is later introduced to a boy named Bruce Lee, who wishes to learn Wing Chun in order to beat up people he does not like. Ip smiles and simply tells him to come back when he has grown up.',\n",

After a school field trip to the Forbidden City, Dre throws a bucket of dirty water over Cheng and his gang as revenge, enraging them. They chase him across the city streets, corner him at a backstreet alley, and brutally beat Dre up until he is saved by the maintenance man, Mr. Han, who fends off the boys and reveals himself to be a Kung Fu master.Mr. Han heals Dre's injuries using Ancient Chinese medicine methods of fire cupping as he tells him that Cheng and his friends are not inherently bad, but made so by their teacher Master Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy towards their enemies. Intrigued, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him Kung Fu. Mr. Han refuses and instead brings him to meet Li at the Fighting Dragon studio to make peace. Li harshly rebuffs the peace offer and challenges Mr.Han or Dre to a fight with Cheng. Mr. Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students one-on-one at the upcoming open Kung Fu tournament, requesting that his students leave Dre alone to train for the tournament. Li begrudgingly agrees to the terms as long as Dre shows up at the tournament.Mr. Han promises to teach Dre Kung Fu and begins to train him by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general. He conveys that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre perform repetitive motions using his jacket, which teaches Dre real muscle memory moves. Han takes Dre to a Taoist temple in the Wudang Mountains. There, Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and later drinks the water from an ancient Taoist well. After many weeks of grueling and laborious training, Mr. Han soon gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to see Meiying, persuading her to cut school for a day of fun. She is nearly late for a violin audition that was pushed up a day without her knowledge. Her parents thus deem Dre a bad influence and forbid her from ever seeing him again.Dre heads to see Mr. Han, but finds him apparently drunk and depressed, smashing the car he was working on. A devastated Mr. Han tearfully explains to Dre that he crashed the same car years ago, and that his wife and 10-year-old son were killed in the crash. He fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened; this inspires Dre to train harder to help his teacher overcome his trauma and get past the incident. Mr. Han assists Dre in writing and reciting a note of apology in Mandarin to Meiying's father, who accepts Dre's gift and apology, promising that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre.At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his competition but soon begins beating them and advances to the semifinals. Cheng does the same by violently finishing off his opponents. Dre then beats Master Li's students, causing Li to order one of his students named Liang, Dre's semi-final opponent, to injure Dre. Liang reluctantly does so by delivering a series of crippling blows to Dre's leg, resulting in an automatic disqualification. Dre can advance to the final to face Cheng but has limited time to return to the ring or Cheng will claim the trophy by default. Dre pleads with Mr. Han to heal his leg via the fire cupping method. Mr. Han reluctantly does so when Dre tells him that he just wants to overcome his fear. Thus, Dre is set to face Cheng in the final.The match goes back and forth with Dre gaining a 2-to-1 lead. On Li's orders, Cheng further hits Dre on his injured leg with a powerful kick, thus causing Dre to lose balance. Tied at two points apiece, with the next point to determine the champion, Dre struggles but manages to get up and uses the snake stance used by the woman at the temple. The move is successful, and Cheng changes his technique and charges at Dre, who does a flip and catches Cheng in mid-air with a kick to his head, winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng presents Dre with the trophy and all of the Fighting Dragon students bow down to Mr. Han in respect, accepting him as their new master, leaving Li defeated. Ending the movie, Dre and Mr. Han walk off happily as the music plays.\",\n",

During a play at the orphanage, Walter ruins the set by crashing into the set when his harness malfunctions. Meanwhile, retired MMA fighter Eddie Sullivan is training a fellow fighter for a tournament in New Orleans with a $100,000 prize. Fellow rival Memphis Earl has also trained a bigger, scarier fighter named Redrum for the tournament. Both of their trainees have a short match, but Eddie\\'s fighter is easily knocked out with one punch. Earl threatens Eddie saying that if he doesn\\'t find a new fighter they\\'ll beat him down.One day Walter is cooking with Henry when Walter suddenly goes to the bathroom and tells Henry to watch the food. Henry is distracted by a game and doesn\\'t see that the food has started a fire. The fire department manages to put the fire out but it leaves the kitchen destroyed. Local law enforcement states that without a working kitchen the orphanage must close down - unless they can get enough money to fix the kitchen in 10 days. Eddie enters a church and asks God to let him find a good fighter in time for the tournament. Meanwhile, the owner of the orphanage is scolding Walter for causing the fire, which causes him to fall into the church from above, seemingly answering Eddie\\'s prayer. Eddie decides to train Walter to be his fighter.Walter is not much of a fighter, but the orphanage owner agrees. However, Mary Alice must go with them. They set off in the orphanage bus to matches around the region. The first match is in a Jefferson City church. Eddie decides to tape and upload the match highlights for internet fan buzz, but during the match Walter doesn\\'t show much of a fight and is easily dominated but manages to win. Meanwhile, Memphis Earl and Redrum go to the gym to see Eddie, and instead find Eddie\\'s father. His father tells them that Eddie isn\\'t there and he recruited a new fighter. That night at a motel Mary and Walter have a talk about their current predicament. Mary doesn\\'t want Walter to fight, but Walter changes her mind by saying that he\\'s on the road for the first time in his life and that he\\'s doing something important.Meanwhile, Earl and Redrum have found the group at the motel and threaten Eddie to stay away from New Orleans. The next day, driving to the next match, the bus engine starts smoking. This causes the bus to crash into a pole and eventually explode. Eddie, Mary, and Walter escape unharmed. Walking on the road with only $200, Mary manages to get a truck driver to take them to the next match. The next fight is at a kid\\'a house, where he hosts fights in his backyard and pays the fighters with the attendance money from other kids. While Eddie gives Walter a pep talk to get him riled up, the kid\\'s dad notices the fights and goes on a rampage, telling everyone to get out of his yard. Walter runs into the backyard and tackles the dad into the fence, thinking he was his opponent.Eddie calls his dad who got injured because of Earl and Redrum and tells him to enter the tournament and win to avenge him. Mary takes them to a trailer park where her friend Tina lives. They tell her of the situation and remember that at a nearby carnival there was a sign that offered anyone to fight a grizzly bear with a $500 prize. Tina gives Walter a new look (shaving his head and giving tattoos), and Walter falls in love with Tina. Walter manages to win with a choke hold and is given the nickname \"The Bear Basher\". Later that night, while riding a bus, Walter has a serious gas attack that leads to the group being kicked off the bus. Meanwhile, Memphis Earl discovers that Walter is a serious threat and might win the tournament, so he decides to adopt Henry and hold him hostage. The orphanage owner refuses to let him adopt Henry even after he promises a good life for him. The group walks to a gas station and Eddie goes in to ask for directions to a rental car company. A motorcycle gang shows up and starts messing with Mary. Eddie attempts to help but is outnumbered by them. Walter comes and fights them off, while Eddie goes in to get the security footage and continue their journey on one of the gang members\\' motorcycles.Throughout the journey, Walter wins more fights, earning more money while Eddie teaches Mary and Walter more fighting moves. During their nightly camp outs, Eddie and Mary start having feelings for each other. Finally arriving in New Orleans, Eddie checks the group in to a luxury hotel, plans a pre-fight celebration for a night on the town and buys Mary a dress and Walter a tuxedo. At the restaurant, Eddie tells Walter to not stare but Eddie does when Mary walks in. Some girls invite Walter to dance, but Mary stays at their table. Mary gets drunk from drinking Eddie\\'s drink and confronts the waitress when she sees her talking to Eddie. This results in a fight, ending with Mary knocking out the waitress with a spinning heel kick. The following day, while Walter is preparing for the tournament at the hotel, Tina shows up to give Walter a pair of shorts she made for him. During the sign-in, Mary calls the orphanage owner saying that the trip is almost over. However, after the call ends a fellow worker informs the owner that they can\\'t find Henry. The man who is in charge of the sign in says that Eddie didn\\'t pre register so Walter can\\'t compete. Mary tells everyone who Walter is so they get into the tournament.Both Walter and Redrum make it to the finals. Backstage, Eddie\\'s dad shows up not wanting to miss the main event. Eddie, not sure if Walter will win, asks his dad to make sure that the money they made on the road makes to the orphanage. Memphis Earl reveals to Mary in the women\\'s restroom why Eddie retired: it was because he was banned from fighting for life after taking a dive in a title fight. When she confronts Eddie, before he can explain the situation the orphanage workers reveal that Memphis Earl has kidnapped Henry and is holding him hostage, unless Walter takes a dive in the fight. Eddie plans to have the match stalled while the workers look for Henry, knowing that Earl won\\'t leave with Redrum in the ring. During the fight, Earl shows up with Henry to distract Walter, but this makes him angry enough to win the fight by submission and Memphis Earl is arrested for kidnapping.During the celebration Eddie\\'s dad reveals that he bet the $4,000 on Walter to win and got $80,000 for the orphanage. Eddie and Mary kiss to end the scene. Walter is then filling a moving truck for his new apartment. He notices Henry looking upset and Henry tells him it\\'s because Walter moving and he\\'s not and that he is losing his best friend. Walter tells Henry that he\\'s going to adopt Henry and wouldn\\'t leave him behind.',\n",
       " 'Ong Bak 3': \"In 1431 in Thailand, Tien (Tony Jaa) is held captive being beaten with wooden staves. On the orders of Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang), his elbows and knees are snapped. As Lord Rajasena sleeps, Tien's guerilla fighters attempt to free Tien, but Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong) appears and kills them. Lord Rajasena offers to hire Bhuti, but he refuses and gives the offer to remove the curse which has been placed on Rajasena before leaving. Rajasena orders his men to kill Tien, but before this can be carried out, a man arrives with a pardon from the king, indicating that he will take Tien, much to Rajasena's ire. The messenger returns Tien to the Kana Khone villagers. After fending off the village from invaders who are after Tien, Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya) feels guilty over Tien's imprisonment and becomes a Buddhist monk. Pim (Primrata Det-Udom) heals Tien to life, but finds that Tien is still crippled from his beatings. Tien then embarks on a rehabilitation regimen with the help of Master Bua.Rajasena visits Bhuti at his temple to remove his curse, but Bhuti reveals his true motive of usurping Rajasena and becoming the new king. After a battle, Bhuti decapitates Rajasena, but his severed head curses Bhuti. After meditating, Tien returns to his village to find it in ruins, and the surviving villagers kidnapped and enslaved by Bhuti. Bhuti uses his magic to summon an eclipse. When Pim reveals herself as Tien's companion, she is taken to Bhuti's palace, where she is killed. Tien witnesses this killing from a statue and fights his way through the guards before confronting Bhuti, who launches a spear at Tien's chest. As he falls to his knees, defeated, he remembers Bua's words, and finds himself again atop the statue. Overcoming Bhuti's illusion, lightning strikes and Bhuti's eclipse magic is dispelled. Bhuti attempts to escape but is confronted by Tien. Bhuti attempts again to throw a spear at Tien, who catches and throws it aside. On the royal ledge above the arena, Tien's upright finger tips hold Bhuti aloft by his chin. Suddenly an elephant's trunk butts the doors below the ledge, causing Bhuti to fall from Tien's grasp. Bhuti falls, over the elephant's tusks. The camera pans as we watch Bhuti dying on the ground, pierced by the elephant's broken tusk. As he breaths his last breath, the elephant, now resembling the one tusk Ganesha, raises his head in a victorious trumpet. Beginning life anew, with good having triumphed over evil, the final scene opens as Tien, Pim and the remaining villagers, pray before the statue of Ong Bak.\",\n",
       " 'Undisputed III: Redemption': 'Years have passed since Yuri Boyka suffered a defeat and a broken knee at the hands of George \"Iceman\" Chambers. Humbled by his injury, he has relegated to becoming the prison janitor. Meanwhile, mob boss Gaga has expanded his prison tournament enterprise into an inter-prison tournament called the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), which gathers the best prison fighters from around the globe to compete for a chance at a cleared record and early release. As Boyka hears the preliminaries taking place within the prison, as well as failing in his parole, he begins training privately to bring his knee back into fighting shape. Just after current champion Vladimir Sykov defeats his opponent in the final round of the prison\\'s tournament, Boyka challenges him on the spot and swiftly defeats him, thus becoming the Russian representative for the PSC.Boyka is transferred to Gorgon prison in the Republic of Georgia where he is joined by a diverse group of eight international prison fighters. Though the fighters are allowed one hour each day for training, they are still grouped into the general population for hard labor while Colombian fighter and local inmate Raul \"Dolor\" Quiñones is given private sparring sessions and a regimen of performance-enhancing drugs. During his stay, Boyka gets into odds with an American fighter Jericho \"Turbo\" Jones who is shown to be disrespectful, insubordinate, and a loudmouth. Boyka, Turbo, Dolor, and Brazilian fighter Andriago Silva advance to the second round of the tournament while the losing fighters are sent home, only to be shot dead by waiting guards.The next day, Turbo starts a fight with Boyka before both men are thrown into solitary confinement. They are eventually released due to some manipulations by their managers Gaga and mafia don Gio Farnatti, who are old friends and rivals. Upon hearing of the prison\\'s treatment of their fighters, the two mob bosses confront Warden Kuss, but PSC mastermind Rezo explains to them that the tournament has always been fixed to ensure the \"highest profit at the lowest risk\". He advises them to liquefy their assets and place their bets on Dolor to ensure their profit. Realizing that the loyalty to their fighters only extend to their payout, Gaga and Farnatti agree to this arrangement. Meanwhile, Boyka and Turbo slowly develop a trust in each other and focus their attention at beating Dolor in the tournament. They both start using the hard labor as part of their training. With Turbo\\'s attitude eroding, he starts showing signs that his ego evolved from a highly disciplined past as a U.S. Marine. In addition to reciting, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome\" as part of his training, he recommends some holistic medicine for Boyka to soothe his knee.In the semi-finals, Boyka defeats Silva by making him tap out to a triangle choke; he helps his opponent up and commends him for a good fight. Realizing that Boyka and Turbo are stronger than predicted, Rezo and Warden Kuss arrange to have the guards beat up Turbo to a bloody pulp. When the prisoners are taken for the next round of hard labor, Boyka tries to convince Turbo into escaping rather than face Dolor wounded. Knowing that Turbo used to be in the military, the plan is to escape to the forest where the security is lightest and survive long enough to eventually get in touch with the black market. Turbo initially disagrees, until another prisoner reveals that the losers are executed. Caught trying to break their chain, the two fight off the guards long enough to get a key. Freed, Turbo makes a run for the forest.Boyka is returned to the prison where he is confronted by Rezo, Warden Kuss, and Gaga. Knowing he has lost all support, he commits himself to ruining their wagers by defeating Dolor in the newly improvised final round. Dolor takes an early lead with his exceptionally quick hand blocks and strikes, as well as exacerbating the problems with Boyka\\'s weak knee by using a submission hold on it. Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is kicked out of the ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the mop and bucket used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count. Remembering Turbo\\'s mantra, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome,\" he takes the blood-soaked pad off the mop and ties it around his knee. Forced to adapt, he begins using a new style mixing in elements of grappling, dirty boxing head-butts and elbows, wrestling, and wu-shu. Dolor, in a final moment of rage, breaks his shin against Boyka\\'s knee block, ending the match.Desperate and despondent, Farnatti confronts Warden Kuss and shoots Rezo over the money that he\\'s lost before being shot by the warden himself. Despite winning the tournament, Boyka is not allowed to go free because the guards have not found Turbo. Because Boyka was responsible for his escape, the arrangement is that Turbo will remain free while Boyka will be transferred back to his original prison, to which Boyka responds that he does not care — he has proven his point. Like the other prisoners, Boyka is instead taken out to be shot, but he is rescued at the last minute by Turbo. The duo retreat to a waiting car where Gaga sits with a suitcase of money. He reveals that he always knew Boyka was the best fighter in the world, especially when he was angry, so he bet all of his money on him all along and deceived the other managers — even going so far as to rescue and hide Turbo when he escaped. Boyka decides to part ways, finally revealing his first name, Yuri, to Turbo. In turn, Turbo confesses that his real name is \"Jericho,\" not realizing that Boyka has a special appreciation for religious references. In gratitude, he thanks Turbo for \"bringing down the walls\" and setting him free. Turbo then requests a match with Boyka in future and Boyka accepts. As the car leaves, Boyka happily walks with the money filled briefcase toward freedom laughing joyfully.',\n",

Although Tin-chi interacts cordially with Ip, he secretly envies and seeks to surpass him.Tin-chi participates in underground fights organized by Ma King-sang, a local triad leader who works for Frank, an American property developer and highly proficient boxer. Frank orders Ma to acquire the land occupied by the school where Ip Ching and Cheung Fong study. When Ip goes to collect his son from school, he witnesses Ma and his men beating the school principal after he refuses to sell. Ip interferes and restrains Ma, but is forced to release him. Ip seeks help from his close friend Fat Po, a local police sergeant. Po agrees to help, but says that he lacks the manpower and influence to protect the school every day. Ip then decides to guard the school alongside his students.That night, Ma's men set fire to the school and attempt to kidnap the principal. Tin-chi happens to be passing by, and helps fight off Ma's thugs. Tin-chi's skills impress Ip, and he thanks Tin-chi for his help. Tin Ngo-san, a local martial arts master and Ma's former mentor, is enraged by Ma's unscrupulous acts and confronts Ma at a Hong Kong shipyard, humiliating him in front of his men. Ma wanted to retaliate with a hidden knife, but Ip stops him. Po arrives and keeps tensions from escalating further. Ma offers Tin-chi a large sum of money to get revenge against Ngo-san on his behalf. Desperate for money, and wanting to open his own martial arts school, Tin-chi accepts the offer and attacks Ngo-san, hospitalizing him.Ip receives a call from the hospital and visits Ngo-san. Upon learning that Ngo-san did not call him, Ip realizes it was a set-up by Ma to lure him away from the school, where Ma's gang have abducted some of the students. Ip arrives alone at Ma's shipyard, where Ma holds Ip Ching at knife point and threatens to sell the children into slavery if the principal refuses to sell the school. Tin-chi is allowed to leave with Fong due to being an associate, but after his son tells him that they still have his friends, he returns and fights alongside Ip. Ip and Cheung are able to hold their own until a troop of policemen led by Po arrives to arrest the gang. Frank dismisses Ma for his failures and sends a Thai boxer after Ip instead.Returning home, Ip learns that Wing-sing has been diagnosed with cancer. On their way home from a medicine shop, Ip and Wing-sing are attacked in an elevator by the Thai boxer, who Ip defeats before the elevator reaches the ground floor. Po tells Ip about Frank, who wants to eliminate Ip at all costs for obstructing his plans. Ip confronts Frank in his office, where Frank promises to leave the school alone if Ip can last an entire three minute fight. Initially overwhelmed by Frank's muscle and sheer force, Ip turns the tide by attacking Frank's lower half. They fight to a draw after the three minutes pass; seemingly impressed, Frank keeps his promise.Tin-chi opens his martial arts school with the money he obtained from Ma, and claims that his Wing Chun is genuine while Ip's is not. He publicly challenges Ip to a battle that will decide who is the true Grandmaster of Wing Chun. However, Ip instead spends more time with his ailing wife, ashamedly feeling that he has neglected her. Wanting to dance with his wife, Ip is taught how to dance by Lee, whom Ip finally accepts as a student. Tin-chi is declared the winner because of Ip's failure to attend but feels unsatisfied. Despite being happy about Ip's decision to accompany her, Wing-sing makes arrangements with Tin-chi for another match on her husband's behalf, correctly guessing that Ip would have attended if not for her deteriorating health. Wing-sing accompanies Ip to the fight where Ip eventually overpowers Tin-chi with a one-inch punch. Tin-chi accepts defeat, and destroys the banner proclaiming himself to be the Grandmaster. Ip tells him that spending time with their closest ones is more important than competing with others.A closing onscreen text states that Wing-sing passed away in 1960, and that Ip helped make Wing Chun well known internationally thus leaving a legacy.\",\n",

The hype though attracts a large audience with even other pro wrestlers Matt Hardy, Tommy Dreamer, and Bubba Ray Dudley defending Stone and pro wrestling saying Stone will beat Reiss and prove everyone wrong. A press conference is held but ends in disaster when Stone's trash talk against Reiss and his wife angers Reiss and nearly starts a fight. The fight begins the next day and the two finally collide. Reiss proves at first the better fighter due to his experience and techniques were as Stone swings wild punches and is too inexperienced. Much to everyone including Reiss' shock Stone proves to tougher than he looks and Reiss' overconfidence and showboating gets the best of him. Stone is able to get Reiss up on the cage using dirty boxing techniques his trainer Danny Thickett (Leo Fafard) used in his heyday and easily picks Reiss up for takedowns. The match ends in a huge upset after hitting Reiss with one punch Stone delivers a devastating uppercut which knocks Reiss out. Reiss awakens but is concussed and confuses the Referee for Stone attempting to wrestle him. The referee stops him and informs the match is over and Stone has won the title. Reiss is humiliated by the match with many of fans now making memes of him crying during the loss even having his movie deals backed out. Angry and wanting revenge he makes Reggie ask Max for a rematch, but Max states she can't.

Reiss decides to retire having his confidence destroyed and his will to fight gone.He wishes to live peaceful with his wife but his money accounts is in the red due to his frivolous spending, bad endorsement deals, and paying for Tony's training camp he wasted losing the fight. Humiliated and hitting rock bottom he sells one of his belts he won to stay afloat. Reggie returns to offer another fight but Reiss declines having now become afraid to fight again and emotionally breaks down in front of his wife. Reggie tracks down Max where he begs for a rematch but Max again refuses not wanting to waste money or damage Reiss' reputation anymore. On Drake's podcast while being interviewed about who's going to fight Stone for the title after his opponent has been forced to retire due to brain damage Max gives in and says she will arrange a rematch for Reiss and Stone. Reiss and his camp are happy to hear this and after making amends to Marcus they start training again. The rematch begins and Stone is dominant most of the fight even tearing Reiss' groin during a failed triangle choke on the latter's part and swelling up his left eye from Stone using an illegal headbutt.

Though they share a love for scaling mountains, the two friends are opposites in their personal lives.  Taylor is a thrill-seeking attorney and womanizer, while Harold is a married, level-headed scientist.On a climb, the pair encounter billionaire Phillip Claiborne (Raymond J. Barry), who is accompanied by a team of fellow climbers. Taylor recognizes Dallas (Luca Bercovici) from law school, and the team lets slip that they are testing equipment for a Himalayan expedition.  That night, two members of Claiborne\\'s team ignore Harold\\'s warnings of an impending avalanche and perish when snow careens down the mountain.  Claiborne and the other survivors are rescued, thanks to quick action by Taylor and Harold.  At the interment, Taylor begs Claiborne to take him and Harold on his expedition to K2, the second highest peak in the world. Claiborne ultimately allows the duo to fill the hole in his team.The entire team heads to the Karakoram, in Pakistan, and starts the climb successfully, though Taylor butts heads with Dallas, while Harold feels guilt over leaving his wife for this adventure.  As the ascent continues, the team\\'s Balti porters go on strike (mirroring the real-world experiences of several expeditions in the 1970s), and altitude sickness incapacitates Claiborne.  A four-man team (Taylor, Harold, Dallas, and Japanese climber Takane) continue toward the summit with minimal gear.  They are stopped when Claiborne authorizes (talking via radio) only two men to go for the summit, while two wait in reserve at the high camp.

       " 'The Eiger Sanction (film)': 'Art professor and mountaineer Jonathan Hemlock is a retired government assassin called on to return to work for two more \"sanctions\", a euphemism for officially approved killings. During his career with a secret government agency called \"C2\", Hemlock amassed a private collection of 21 rare masterpiece paintings, paid for from his previous sanctions. The director of C2, Dragon, is an albino ex-Nazi confined to semi-darkness and kept alive by blood transfusions. Dragon wants Hemlock to kill two men responsible for the death of another government agent, code name Wormwood. Insisting he is retired, Hemlock refuses until Dragon threatens to expose Hemlock\\'s art collection to the Internal Revenue Service. Hemlock agrees, and travels to Zurich, where he carries out the first sanction for $20,000, twice his usual fee (equivalent to $105,000 in 2020), and a letter guaranteeing no trouble from the IRS.Returning from Europe, Hemlock meets C2 courier Jemima Brown, who seduces him, and while he is asleep, steals his money and IRS exemption letter. Dragon agrees to return them if Hemlock completes the second sanction. Hemlock is reluctant, but agrees when he learns that the C2 agent killed, Wormwood, was in fact his old friend Henri Baq. Hemlock is an ex-Green Beret, and  Baq and he had served together during the Vietnam War, where Baq saved his life. Dragon agrees to pay him $100,000 (equivalent to $525,000 in 2020) plus expenses, and tells him the target is a member of an international mountain-climbing team that will soon attempt an ascent of the north face of the Eiger mountain in Switzerland. Hemlock will be the American member of the team, and must kill one of the climbers—Dragon is unsure of the target\\'s identity other than the man walks with a limp.Hemlock travels to Arizona to train at a climbing school run by a friend, Ben Bowman, who whips him back into shape with the help of an attractive Native American woman named George. Hemlock also encounters an enemy, Miles Mellough, a former ally from the military, who years before had betrayed him in Southeast Asia. Mellough somehow knows a great deal of what Hemlock is planning. He tries to kill Hemlock by hiring George to seduce and drug him, but Hemlock survives. Later, Hemlock lures Mellough and his bodyguard into the desert, shoots and kills the bodyguard, and leaves Mellough to die in the sun.Hemlock travels to Switzerland with Bowman, the \"ground man\" or supervisor of the climb, and meets the other members of the climbing party at the Hotel Bellevue des Alpes at Kleine Scheidegg. The headstrong and condescending German member, Karl Freytag (Reiner Schöne), presents his proposed route up the mountain, and the team agrees that he will lead the party. The following morning, the men begin their ascent of the Eiger north face, but soon the weather conditions become poor. The French climber is struck by falling rocks and later dies. With Hemlock now leading, the surviving members retreat towards a tunnel window that connects to the Eigerwand railway station, carrying the dead climber between them. At the last moment, Freytag and the Austrian, Anderl Meyer, fall to their deaths. Hemlock is saved, dangling alone a few metres from the tunnel window.Bowman and a rescue crew make their way through the Eiger to the tunnel window, where they attempt to throw a rope to Hemlock. Hemlock notices Bowman is limping, a sign that identifies him as Hemlock\\'s target. Hemlock says, \"You\\'re limping, Ben,\" reluctant to trust that Bowman will rescue him. Bowman throws him the rope, and Hemlock attaches it, then reluctantly cuts his own rope. He falls onto Bowman\\'s rope, and is pulled into the tunnel to safety. On the train back to Kleine Scheidegg, Bowman admits he became involved with \"the other side\" years earlier, but claims he had no idea that Henri Baq would be killed. Bowman explains he had become involved with Miles Mellough, to whom he was indebted for getting George (who is actually Bowman\\'s daughter) off drugs.Back at Kleine Scheidegg, Bowman approaches Hemlock, looking to mend his relationship with the assassin. Hemlock takes a phone call from Dragon, who is convinced that -- since C2 was never able to positively ID the target -- Hemlock killed all three of the other climbers intentionally to ensure he completed the job. Hemlock tells Bowman that C2 believes the target died on the mountain, and that no reason exists to tell them otherwise. After Bowman leaves, Jemima Brown joins Hemlock and wonders if Dragon was correct.',\n",
       " 'Vertical Limit': \"While climbing in Monument Valley, siblings Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie Garrett (Tunney) lose their father, Royce (Stuart Wilson). After two falling climbers leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose in order to save Peter and his sister. Three years later, Peter has retired from climbing, but Annie has become a renowned climber. Their relationship is strained, as Annie still blames Peter for the death of their father. Peter reunites with Annie at the K2 base camp, where Annie is planning a summit attempt on K2. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton). Their team includes Annie, Vaughn, renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea), mountaineer Ali Nazir, and one other.The night before the climb, Vaughn throws a party. The gala is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick (Glenn), reportedly the foremost K2 expert, who verbally challenges Vaughn. It's later revealed that Wick's wife, an expedition guide, died during Vaughn's previous expedition. Vaughn claims they were hit by a storm and Wick's wife died of pulmonary edema because her supply of dexamethasone was swept away in the storm. Wick has never believed that story and has spent years trying to find his wife's body. During the present climb, Vaughn forces McLaren to continue despite a radio warning from base camp of an approaching storm. An avalanche occurs, and Annie, Vaughn, and McLaren become trapped in a crevasse, while the other two are killed. Radio contact is lost, but Peter hears Annie using static and Morse code to signal that they are alive. Peter assembles a rescue team, which includes Wick. Pairs are assigned, and after a treacherous helicopter drop-off, each pair takes a different path to increase chances of success. Each pair carries a canister of explosive nitroglycerine donated by the Pakistani army to clear the entrance to the crevasse.Monique and Cyril experience a harrowing incident after Cyril loses his balance at the edge of a cliff. While Monique attempts to rescue him, their nitro canister falls over the cliff and explodes, causing another avalanche. Monique survives, but Cyril does not. At the military station, the nitroglycerine canisters are exposed to sunlight and explode. Base camp tells the team to get their cases of nitro into the shade. Kareem and Malcolm do so, but their canister leaks fluid into the sunlight, causing an explosion that kills them. Underground, McLaren is severely injured and has lost his dexamethasone. Annie shares her dex with him, but Vaughn refuses it. Annie risks her life to reach Ali's backpack and manages to obtain more dex, but Vaughn says that since McLaren is unlikely to survive, he and Annie should keep the dex for themselves.The explosions have shaken loose some ice, and Wick finally discovers his wife's body. The empty dex container nearby suggests that Vaughn lied and stole her dex, ensuring his own survival while leaving Wick's wife to die. Monique, Peter, and Wick camp for the night. Peter is wary of Wick, who seems more intent on taking revenge than in rescuing the survivors. In the crevasse, Annie falls asleep, and Vaughn kills McLaren with a syringe full of air to avoid having to give McLaren more dex. Wick awakens to find that Peter and Monique have left without him. Annie and Vaughn manage to mark the crevasse entrance by detonating a flare inside a bag of McLaren's blood which explodes over the snow. Peter and Monique see the marker and use nitro to blast a hole, enabling access to the survivors. They drop a rope, and Vaughn harnesses Annie.Wick descends into the cave, and although Vaughn thinks Wick will attack him, Wick attaches a clip to Vaughn. Monique and Peter attempt to pull Annie out of the crevasse, but an ice boulder falls, knocking Wick and Vaughn from the ledge in the crevice, and pulling Annie and Peter down, creating a scenario similar to the opening scene: Monique alone remains on the ledge holding the rope from which the other four are dangling. To save Annie and Peter—and to fulfill his desire for revenge against Vaughn—Wick cuts the rope, and he and Vaughn fall to their deaths.Recovering at base camp, Annie reconciles with Peter, who then pays his respects at a makeshift memorial for climbers who have died.\",\n",
       " 'Touching the Void (film)': \"In 1985, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, both experienced mountaineers, successfully ascended the previously unclimbed West Face of Siula Grande in Peru. After leaving the summit their descent by way of the North Ridge proves unexpectedly difficult in, at times, stormy weather conditions. Shortly after the pair leave the summit Yates falls through a cornice and plummets down the 4500\\xa0ft face they had just climbed but his fall is arrested by their climbing ropes. After a bivouac high on the peak, the pair continue their descent the following morning but then Simpson falls whilst climbing down an ice cliff on the ridge and, landing awkwardly, suffers a badly broken leg. The pair commence a self-rescue with Yates lowering Simpson with ropes down a steep, 3000\\xa0ft, snow and ice slope while the weather deteriorates into a fierce storm. The total length of rope the pair have is 300\\xa0ft so the lowering process has to be undertaken in a series of repeat manoeuvres. The pair had almost reached the relative safety of the glacier when Yates inadvertently lowers Simpson over the edge of a large cliff, leaving him suspended on the rope in mid-air. Yates arrests his partner's fall, but cannot see the predicament he is in, nor hear him over the howling wind.Unable to pull Simpson back up the cliff and gradually losing traction in the loose snow, Yates realizes, after about an hour and a half, that he is gradually being pulled from his unbelayed stance and will eventually fall in excess of 150 feet to his almost certain death. Yates decides that the only option available to him to avoid being pulled from the cliff is to cut the rope connecting him with Simpson. After surviving a sub-zero and stormy night on the mountain Yates completed his descent to the surface of the glacier but cannot find his partner concluding that Simpson must have fallen to the large crevasse at the base of the cliff. He inspects the opening of the crevasse to the extent that he can without falling in himself and calls out to try and communicate with Simpson. Receiving no response Yates concludes Simpson must be dead and he returns to the base camp alone, where he stays to recuperate from his ordeal.Simpson, however, survived the fall and is now trapped in the large crevasse. He manages to lower himself further into the dark abyss and finds an exit leading to the surface of the glacier. He then spends three days crawling and hopping back to base camp across the glacier and moraines, despite his broken leg, frostbite, and severe dehydration. Exhausted and delirious, Simpson reaches camp only a few hours before Yates and Richard Hawking (a non-climber who was the third member of the expedition) intend to leave and return to civilization.The main docudrama ends when Simpson reaches base camp to find Yates and Hawking still in residence and his safety is then assured. The DVD contains two additional documentary features.  What Happened Next documents what happened after Simpson reached base camp and how he was evacuated to hospital in Lima by his two companions and his subsequent return to England.  Return to Siula Grande documents the making of the film in 2002 and the thoughts and reactions of Simpson, Yates and Hawking when they return to the scene of their epic adventure.\",\n",

Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp. A month earlier in New Zealand, Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife, Jan, and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp, Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their unborn baby is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.Worried about climbers overcrowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs from Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and begin descending by 2:00 PM., the latest safe time to ensure return before nightfall. The group is delayed by over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on the upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return to base camp if his condition does not improve in a half-hour.

       " 'Airborne (1993 film)': 'Mitchell Goosen (McDermott) is a teenager from California who loves to surf and rollerblade.  His zoologist parents are given the opportunity for grant work in Australia for six months. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio, so as to finish the remainder of his high school semester. He arrives in Cincinnati in the midst of a winter storm, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free-spirited ocean atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. He meets his cousin Wiley (Green), an awkward but affable teenager and his aunt and uncle whose lifestyle and demeanor, though warm and hospitable, is a bit old-fashioned.Mitchell\\'s first day at school is met with the typical fish out of water obstacles as he immediately grows to the disfavor and jealousy of the gritty hockey players who chastise Mitchell for his easygoing \"Maharishi\" philosophy and \"California\" appearance. These antagonists include Jack (Conrad), Augie (Black), Snake (Vargas), Rosenblatt, and the Banduccis. With an upcoming hockey game against the rival \"preps\", led by the aggressive and arrogant Blane, Wiley and subsequently Mitchell are asked to fill-in for two students who are caught putting a laxative into one of their teacher\\'s coffee. Mitchell accidentally scores a goal for the preps, cementing his status as outcast with the hockey players. Jack is particularly upset and proceeds to tackle Mitchell while still on the ice, concussing him and leaving him unconscious for what appears to be hours.Over the course of the next few weeks, Mitchell and Wiley are harassed and pranked relentlessly, but one bright spot comes in the form of a girl named Nikki (Powell), who Mitchell makes a deep connection with. During a double date with Wiley and Nikki\\'s friend Gloria, Blane (who is revealed as Nikki\\'s ex) appears and physically confronts Mitchell and Nikki. Mitchell, a staunch pacifist, is attempting to defuse the situation peacefully even as Wiley is hurt in the confrontation. The intervention of Jack further complicates the situation as he is revealed to be Nikki\\'s brother, and is not happy to see her with Mitchell. Mitchell is at first flippant to Jack\\'s aggression, but steadfastly refuses to fight Jack. At Jack\\'s insistence that Mitchell is backing out because he\\'s scared, Mitchell\\'s laidback stoicism cracks and he replies that he won\\'t fight Jack because he and subsequently anyone else in Cincinnati isn\\'t worth his time or effort as he\\'s leaving in three months. Upon hearing this, Nikki leaves, heartbroken, having taken his comments to include her as well. Wiley also expresses his disappointment in Mitchell for not at least standing up for Nikki.Sometime later, Mitchell is inspired by a dream (involving a Spanish-speaking shark named Pepe) to fight for Nikki without fighting Jack. Wiley is skeptical, but follows his cousin to a street hockey game between Jack\\'s friends and the Preps the next day. Mitchell approaches the team who ostensibly agree to let him play (hoping to watch him suffer an injury), but are taken aback when he easily scores a goal against the preps. In the next play, it would appear that Mitchell suffers a setback when Blane takes a cheap shot, and he again backs down from a fight, but then Mitchell takes his revenge by sneaking up on Blane and pantsing him in front of the crowd, revealing he\\'s not wearing any underwear under his jock strap. He escapes a pack of preps, but only after reconciling with Nikki, asserting to her that there are some things worth fighting for. Snake, Augie, the Banduccis, and Rosenblatt (Jack being notably absent) visit Mitchell at home, at first appearing to be hostile but then raising him up over their heads, celebrating his actions against Blane and finally accepting him as a new friend. They solicit Mitchell\\'s help and rollerblading expertise in a race down a harrowing street route termed \"Devil\\'s Backbone\" against the preps to settle their score once and for all.On the day of the race, it is agreed upon that the first team with three members crossing the finish line will be deemed the winner. Jack and Mitchell have a silent moment where they at least grudgingly appear to bury the hatchet. The race begins and many skaters, including Augie, are injured. Snake takes the lead, with two of the preps struggling to keep pace with him. Jack and Blane follow, and after some difficult struggles, Mitchell start to bridge the gap. The remaining preps fall behind when the Banducci twins forego racing altogether in favor of simply fighting them all.

Ralph didn’t want Brink to spend even more time skating so he forbade Brink from taking the job. However, Brink disobeys him. Ralph being unaware that Brink took the job and since Brink had said he wanted to work, Ralph gets him a part-time job at Pup-N-Suds, a dog grooming business. This, however, is a job which Jordy, Gabriella, and Peter are aware of because Brink had told them that he\\'s working there.

He is an up-and-coming street skateboarder from Chicago with all the talent but has the world against him. He and his fellow skateboarding friends Cash (Ryan Dunn), Reese (Terry Kennedy), and Troy (Rob Dyrdek), as well as filmographer friend Mikey (Adam Wylie), spend their days skating at spots around the city, being pursued by cops for skating where they shouldn't be, and planning how to make names for themselves. In Derrick's case, this means landing one special trick on-camera for a sponsorship video that has never been done before, affectionately dubbed the N.A.C. (Not A Chance) by his friends. Unfortunately, the handrail at the local university he needs to practice his trick on has been skate-proofed, preventing him from making that goal a reality.At home, Derrick's passion has started interfering with his high school education, causing tension between him and his father (Yancey Arias). At the same time, Derrick's preppy, partying girlfriend Samantha (Jordan Valley) is starting to make him lose focus of his goals with her high-maintenance personality. After the stress between Derrick and Samantha comes to a boil and they break up, he joins his friends on a trip to Ohio to visit a skate park with the perfect rail to practice the N.A.C., and so they all can practice for the coming Tampa AM amateur skateboarding contest in Florida. However, when Troy notices Derrick gaining more attention from sponsors and professional photographers while practicing the N.A.C., his jealousy takes over and forces the group to pack up and leave before Derrick can successfully land his trick. Thankfully, before leaving, Derrick has the chance to meet well-renowned skater Eric Jones (Ryan Sheckler), and attractive older sister Taylor (C.C. Sheffield), and learns Eric will be competing in the Tampa Am contest as well.When Derrick returns home to a furious father and the boring school routine, the only thing Derrick can think about is finally landing the N.A.C., so he comes up with a plan: taking an angle grinder to the welded knobs on the university rail, and skate it all night. To do this, he enlists the help and trust of his friends to watch for cops as he cuts the knobs off. All goes according to plan, until cops eventually show up, and Troy, who saw them coming, deliberately fails to inform the rest of the group, resulting in Derrick and Mikey getting arrested. This causes the tension and anger between Derrick and his father to reach a critical point, resulting in thrown fists and Derrick running away with his friends to Florida to compete in the Tampa AM.Arriving in Tampa, the gang immediately gets into various shenanigans; Derrick plays a game of S.K.A.T.E. with some other skateboarders there for the competition, Cash and Reese cause a fiery explosion in the parking lot of their motel, and after dropping off their stuff in their room, head to the Ybor City strip to party. However, this quickly goes awry after Cash and Troy get too drunk on shots and cause a fistfight that ends with Cash being taken to jail for the night. Finally Derrick has had enough of Troy's ego and calls him out on his faults in front of the group, prompting Troy to confess to letting the cops arrest Derrick and Mikey back at the rail. In a rage, Derrick abandons the group, just in time for Eric and Taylor to find him and allow him a place to stay in their motel room. After having a talk with Taylor, Derrick calls his father to let him know where he is and that he's okay, and his father wishes him luck in the competition.The next day, Derrick arrives at the Tampa AM with Eric and Taylor, where Mikey, Reese, and a freshly-out-of-jail Cash happily meet up with him. During pre-competition practice though, Troy makes it abundantly clear that he and Derrick are enemies here, shoulder-checking Derrick and knocking him off his board. As the competition begins, Troy appears to be faring better than Derrick, landing all of his tricks with Derrick only landing three. However, because Derrick's tricks were harder and Troy played it easy with more basic tricks, Derrick leaves Troy behind as he qualifies first place for the finals. Troy is initially furious, but finally Cash steps up and puts him in his place, as well as a headlock. With the dust settled, all of Derrick's friends wish him luck on his final run.With the support of his friends carrying him, Derrick advances to the finals with full confidence. His plan here is simple: to land the N.A.C. in his final run. As he approaches his end goal he is certain of his ability to do so, but even at the last moment, Derrick fails once again trying to land it. However, even though the clock has run out and it won't count for the competition, the judges and fellow competitors want to see Derrick try again. With all of the skateboarding world watching, Derrick finally lands the N.A.C., with plenty of footage from Mikey for his sponsorship video.

Although Lane also owns a 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running and it sits in the driveway in a dilapidated state.Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of \"almost 8\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from \"How-to\" books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from breaking his garage door windows with thrown newspapers.

When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.Due to a misunderstanding between the chair lift operators, the lift was shut off before the three of them could get out. They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week.

       " 'Eddie the Eagle (film)': 'In 1973, after a long period of medical treatment for walking difficulties, ten-year-old Michael Edwards dreams of Olympic glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favour of skiing in the Winter Games. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realising he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated for six decades), he decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany. The more seasoned jumpers, especially the Norwegian team, belittle him.Edwards self-trains, and after successfully completing the 15-metre (49\\xa0ft) hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first attempt at a 40-metre (130\\xa0ft) slope. Alcoholic snow groomer Bronson Peary advises Eddie to give up, but Eddie\\'s tenacious spirit and a shared sense of being an outsider convince Bronson to train Eddie. Peary is an American former champion ski jumper who left the sport in his twenties after a conflict with his mentor, Warren Sharp, as Eddie learns from Petra, a cafe owner who takes him in. With very little time to qualify for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to condition and refine Eddie\\'s form, and he successfully completes the 40m hill.To qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie only needs to complete a jump from a 70-metre (230\\xa0ft) hill. He manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112\\xa0ft), thus winning a place on the British Olympic Team. However, the officials, in an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, change their criteria and demand that he jump at least 61 metres (200\\xa0ft). Though discouraged, Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time.While practicing for the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, he lands a 61m jump exactly, but misses the mark on his official jump and is disqualified. Eddie resolves to return home to work with his father as a plasterer, but he receives a letter stating that his qualifying practice jump is valid, and he tells Bronson that he is eligible to compete in the Winter Olympics. Bronson suggests he wait until the 1992 games and train for the next four years to give himself a better chance of winning a medal, concerned that he will make a fool of himself and his country if he goes ahead, but Eddie is undeterred, since simply competing in the Olympics was always his goal.Upon arriving in Calgary, he is scorned by the other British competitors, who get him drunk so that he fails to attend the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with 60.5 metres (198\\xa0ft), Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie \"The Eagle\". Over the phone, Bronson criticizes Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologises for his antics and, wanting to ensure he does not leave the games without recognition, he enters the 90-metre (300\\xa0ft) jump, which he has never attempted before. Bronson now travels to the games to support him.After an encouraging conversation with his idol Matti \"The Flying Finn\" Nykänen on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie miraculously lands a 71.5-metre (235\\xa0ft) jump. Once again, he comes last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience and TV viewers worldwide, which earns him recognition in the closing speech of the President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, Frank King, who says, \"You have broken world records. You have established many of your own personal bests and some of you have even soared like an Eagle\". British Olympic officials grudgingly accept him.Warren Sharp is reconciled with Bronson, and Edwards returns home a national hero, welcomed by fans at the airport, as well as his mother and father; the latter reveals he is wearing a jumper that says \"I\\'m Eddie\\'s dad,\" and says he is proud of him.',\n",

That same day, Bruno's shifty and opportunistic friend, Kalle (Oliver Korittke), who loses a job for the third time in a year, has intentions to enter his overweight friend into the upcoming Sumo World championship that is being held in the city of Riesa, hoping that the fifty thousand marks purse will changed their lives for the better.Later that night, Kalle talks Bruno into a double-date with Gina (Esther Esche) and Bärbel (Sandra Steffi), and going to the local discothèque, Lucky's Temple of Dance.

Unbeknownst to Bruno, Kalle's plan was to volunteer his strong, heavyset buddy into a sumo wrestling contest, to show Bruno that he's good at it, and the winner gets a prize for two hundred marks. As expected, Bruno mops-up the inferior competition and wins the prize, but unexpectedly, he's challenged by Lucky to a boxing match.

       " 'Blue Crush': \"Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) and her 14-year-old sister, Penny (Mika Boorem), along with good friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake), live in a small house on the North Shore. They all have been helping raise Anne Marie's young sister, ever since the mother took off to Las Vegas with a boyfriend.While Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden, and Lena work as maids in a super-luxury resort hotel, but more important than that, they are surfers. Anne Marie rises every morning before dawn to train for a possible surfing comeback. As a child, she had been a rising star in women's surfing, until she suffered a near-fatal wipeout. This has temporarily halted her progress; now when she is in really big powerful surf, she has deep-seated fears of dying. Her friends, especially Eden, are encouraging her to try once again to become a professional surfer.Anne Marie has been invited to join an upcoming surf competition at the famed North Shore surf spot, the very challenging Banzai Pipeline. If she can do well enough to gain the attention of a sponsor, it would lift her and her friends out of the near-poverty in which they live. As the Pipeline competition gets closer, Anne Marie struggles to keep her young sister Penny from running wild, and also tries to deal with her own personal issues.At work at the hotel, Anne Marie catches the eye of Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis), a National Football League quarterback who is in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl (it is hinted that he plays for the Minnesota Vikings). Matt is instantly attracted to the surfer. After a few encounters, Matt says he wants to learn to surf, and Anne Marie agrees to teach him, and several of his rowdy teammates, to surf for $150 per hour, with Lena, Eden, and Penny also acting as coaches. When Anne Marie goes to Matt's hotel room to pick up the money, they kiss, but a call comes in. Anne Marie asks if it is Matt's wife, but he explains it is his niece. Later they sleep together.Anne Marie's acceptance of a non-Hawaiian as her boyfriend causes friction between her and some of the young male surfers on the North Shore. Eden points out to Anne Marie that her current interest in Matt has weakened her commitment to training for the Pipeline contest. Anne Marie overhears very demeaning comments about herself from some of the other football players' wives and girlfriends who are also staying at the hotel.Anne Marie confronts Matt about their situation. She soon resolves to step up her game, as she finally commits herself to the Pipeline Masters. On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but she advances to the next heat after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt. She is shaken, but Matt tells her how he failed in his first game as an NFL quarterback, and this helps her get control of her wavering confidence.Determined, although still apprehensive, Anne Marie returns to the water. Competing in the same heat is Keala Kennelly, one of the first professional female surfers. While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves well, Anne Marie is still reluctant to try one, visions of her near-drowning incident holding her back. Keala finishes her turn, then paddles back out to take Anne Marie under her wing. Keala encourages her to ride the best wave of the day, and Anne Marie rides it perfectly, managing to score a perfect ten. Although Anne Marie cannot advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence and attracted the attention of sponsors, one of whom immediately offers to have her join the Billabong women's surf team.\",\n",

En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe, a nice, but dim-witted rooster surfer from Sheboygan, Wisconsin.The entrants arrive at Pen-Gu Island, where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani Aliikai, a female gentoo penguin who is a lifeguard. He also meets the contest\\'s arrogant champion, Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans, who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z\\'s supposed death during a previous match ten years ago. Cody sees Tank throwing rocks at Big Z\\'s memorial and immediately challenges him to a surfing duel. Tank wins the duel while Cody nearly drowns and is stung by a sea urchin named Ivan. Lani rescues him and takes him to her uncle, Geek, to help Cody recover from his injuries. Cody wakes up, but cannot find the souvenir necklace given to him as a child by Big Z. Geek then finds it in his hut.While returning the necklace, Geek finds Cody sitting on a koa log and offers to help him make a surfboard. They attempt to take the log back to Geek\\'s house, only to lose control of it and end up on a beach far away from the house. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a shack full of old trophies and surfboards, which used to belong to Big Z. After observing Geek walking sadly into the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Big Z and asks him to teach him how to surf. Z reluctantly agrees, but tells Cody he has to make his own board first. The attempt does not go well, however, as an impatient Cody refuses to listen to Z\\'s advice and crafts a weak and unstable board that shatters upon hitting the water. Angry, Cody storms off and runs into Lani, who, after convincing him to land-surf through a volcanic caverns, persuades Cody to return. Cody does, and spends the night working patiently on a new board.Z compliments Cody on his new board, and Cody is eager to start training. Z instead has him perform menial and absurd tasks seemingly unrelated to surfing, and takes pleasure in Cody\\'s frustration. Finally, when Cody starts having fun by also pulling pranks on Z, the ex-surfer teaches him how to surf the waves. Afterwards, Cody asks Z if he will come watch the contest, but Z refuses, revealing that he faked his death because he realized he couldn\\'t compete with his then-new rival Tank, and that he had become too focused on winning.

On Halloween, Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, and the girls go surfing with Alana's father Holt and brother Byron. As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water while she is talking to Alana, a shark unexpectedly attacks and bites off her left arm just below the shoulder. Holt, Alana, and Byron get her out of the water where Holt makes a tourniquet out of his swimshirt to put on her while Byron calls 911 as Cheri is also informed. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Tom's knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, she also lost over 60% of her blood and Dr. Rovinsky calls her survival a miracle.The onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Her injury prevents her from participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well.Local fisherman eventually catch and kill the same shark that bit Bethany's arm off, much to Tom's satisfaction when he tests the size of its mouth with the bite size on Bethany's surfboard.Bethany perseveres and after a recuperation period, gets back in the water, and learns to surf with one arm. Inside Edition offers to provide a prosthetic one that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. She angrily rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump.Bethany eventually re-enters the competition, telling rival Malina not to go easy on her, and rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave so Malina wins.

She decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.Tom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Tom's belief in his daughter's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany, inviting her up on the platform to share first place.Subsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her.

       " \"Surf's Up 2: WaveMania\": 'Ten years after the events of Surf\\'s Up, the now 27-year-old northern rockhopper penguin Cody Maverick lives in obscurity on Pen Gu Island, where he teaches children to surf in his own surf school alongside gentoo penguin Lani Aliikai, opposed by his former rival Tank Evans, who also runs his own surf school. As a result of winning the Big Z Memorial, Chicken Joe has become a world-famous surfer, performing in competitions around the world.Chicken Joe leaves his world tour to visit Pen Gu island. At the same time, \"The Hang 5\", a team of extreme surfers and thrillseekers (consisting of sea otter Mr. McMahon, penguins J.C. (John Cena), The Undertaker, Hunter (Triple H) and Paige, and their announcer Seagull), arrive on the island. Since Cody was a big fan of them from childhood, he invites the whole team to his place and throws a party in their honor. At the party, Mr. McMahon reveals that the team are on a journey to a mythical surf spot called the \"Trenches\" to ride a 50 feet (15\\xa0m) rogue wave, and further reveals to his team that he is retiring, and came to the island to find his replacement. After Mr. McMahon and Paige choose Lani, Cody and Tank respectively convince J.C. and Hunter to sponsor them as potential replacements for McMahon, the Undertaker randomly selecting Chicken Joe so that he will also have a candidate, unaware of his fame.The group subsequently leaves the island atop a whale. Having approached an unknown coastline, they walk (and later surf) through a desert for a time (encountering quicksand), before reaching a jungle, at which the group stops for the night. The next day, while searching the jungle, they find a temple, the remains of an ancient penguin civilization that worshipped the art of surfing, Tank discovering a golden surfboard. Further, the group uses improvised hang gliders combined with surfboards to cross a lava lake on Cody\\'s suggestion (from having viewed hieroglyphs from the temple), during which, due to his bickering with Tank, he almost knocks Chicken Joe into the lava, and The 5 harshly berate him for his behavior. Feeling immense guilt, Cody leaves overnight, while the group, feeling remorse (except for Tank, obviously) for the way they spoke to Cody (especially J.C., who said that Cody was nothing like them and he never will be), since if it wasn’t for Cody they never would’ve gotten over the lava, moves onwards towards the Palisade.While walking back, Cody comes across another set of hieroglyphs depicting the civilization\\'s champion riding the waves of the island and his eventual death in The Trenches, leading to Cody deciding to return to warn Chicken Joe and Lani. Meanwhile, the rest of the group arrives at The Trenches, where Seagull is struck by lightning and disintegrated; Lani deduces the \"RTL\" catchphrase of The Hang 5 as being in reference to the act of \"ride the lightning\", i.e. surfing during a thunderstorm, which they have previously done worldwide. After admitting that all members of The Hang 5 are by definition \"crazy\" and that one must \"RTL\" to join, Lani declines membership, Chicken Joe accepts an honorary membership from the Undertaker, and Tank reluctantly agrees to \"RTL\" in order to acquire the fame and fortune associated with being a member.Assembling before the formation of a 50 feet (15\\xa0m) rogue wave, The Hang Five and Tank ride atop of it as lightning rages overhead. Having changed his mind, and in fear for his life, a redeemed Tank swims off behind the wave, pursued by lightning because of his surfboard\\'s metallic nature, while The Hang 5 continues maneuvering between lightning bolts; the Undertaker is struck by lightning and falls into the water. He is rescued by Paige and J.C. and brought to the shoreline, where his heart is found to have stopped beating; the Undertaker is subsequently revived by Chicken Joe through the use of jellyfish stings (as natural AEDs). The group then witnesses a returning Cody rescuing Tank. After such a selfless act, Mr. McMahon invites Cody to join their team, but he refuses, having become unwilling to abandon his friends and his island. Impressed by Cody, Mr. McMahon decides to stave off his retirement and desire for \"fish milk\" to remain with the team further.[5]',\n",

Moments after a justice of the peace pronounces the redheaded Steve and Caroline man and wife, Maria rushes in, claiming that Steve is her husband and the father of her three redheaded children, which she has paraded in at that moment. Although Steve pleads his innocence, Caroline storms off in a rage and returns to her teaching post at Victoria College in New Jersey. A determined Steve and his friend, Carlos Ramirez, follow her there, but are denied entrance to the all-female school.Later, in a New York nightclub, Steve meets drunken lawyer Chester Klazenfrantz (Donald Meek), and learns that Klazenfrantz has been hired to change the charter of Victoria College, which has never officially designated itself as all-female. Armed with this information, Steve returns to Victoria and insists on applying for admission. Unaware of Caroline\\'s relationship to Steve, Dean Clinton (Nana Bryant) suggests to the faculty that he be admitted for a two-week probationary period, during which time they would give him 100 demerits, which would qualify him for expulsion before Parents Day.Once enrolled, Steve tries to speak with Caroline, but she refuses to listen to his explanations and tells him she is seeking an annulment.

Concerned about the approaching Parents Day, Dean Clinton, meanwhile, commands Steve\\'s professors, who have penalized him with only fifty-five demerits, to bear down on him. To that end, Mme. Zarka (Ann Codee), Steve\\'s ruthlessly strict ballet teacher, forces him to wear a tutu and dance with the co-eds, but Steve once again rises to the occasion.A now desperate Dean Clinton asks Caroline to go out with Steve and ensure that he arrives back at Victoria after the curfew.

It was a dysfunctional family, since Harold, the child of an alcoholic mother who had witnessed his mother\\'s degradation as a prostitute when a child, was violent and unable to show equal love to all his children, and favored those showing sporting prowess. He was physically and emotionally abusive, especially toward Tony and Dora. She tried to protect Tony from that abuse which only angered Harold more.

The unit\\'s men are distrustful of the professionally aloof Lawrence, and the relationship immediately takes a turn for the worse when they brawl with sailors aboard their transport ship. The ship\\'s captain, Lt. Cmdr.

Back on the ship, Creighton is put in traction because of the bullets in his spine, and Flannigan confesses to Lawrence that the prank caused Creighton\\'s injuries. Lawrence furiously upbraids Flannigan for giving in to the prank, and soon all of the men request transfers.While Lawrence is discussing the transfer requests with Vincent, a torpedo hits the ship but does not detonate. Lawrence volunteers to disarm the torpedo, which has lodged in the sick bay next to Creighton\\'s bed, and with Flannigan\\'s help, succeeds. Soon after, Lawrence receives orders to blow up a Japanese submarine pen, and tells the men that although it will be their last mission together, he is proud to have served with them. Although Flannigan voices disdain that Lawrence will again dodge dangerous duty, Lawrence leads the mission, which is discovered when one of the men accidentally trips a signal wire. Japanese sentries shoot at the men as they plant the charges, and Lawrence is stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a Japanese diver. He orders Flannigan to leave him behind, but Flannigan tows him to safety. The mission is a success, and soon Lawrence is recuperating beside Creighton. Finally won over by Lawrence\\'s bravery, the men show their acceptance of him by asking him to sign the portrait they have drawn of Cassidy to present to his widow.',\n",

       " 'World Without Sun': 'World Without Sun, a documentary produced and directed by Jacques Cousteau in 1964 chronicles Continental Shelf Station Two, or \"Conshelf Two\", the first ambitious attempt to create an environment in which men could live and work on the seafloor.  In it, a half-dozen oceanauts lived 10 meters down in the Red Sea off Sudan in a star-fish shaped house for 30 days.  The undersea living experiment also had two other structures, one a submarine hangar that housed a small, two-man submarine referred to as the \"diving saucer\" for its resemblance to a science fiction flying saucer, and a smaller \"deep cabin\" where two oceanauts lived at a depth of 30 meters for a week.  The undersea colony was supported by air, water, food, power, all essentials of life, from a large support team above.  Men on the bottom performed a number of experiments intended to determine the practicality of working on the sea floor and were subjected to continual medical examinations.  The documentary, 93 minutes long, received wide international theatrical distribution, and was awarded an Academy Award for Best Documentary,[1][2]  as well as numerous other honors. It was Cousteau\\'s second film to win Best Documentary, the first being The Silent World released in 1956.Funded in part by the French petrochemical industry, the Conshelf Two experiment was originally intended to demonstrate the practicality of exploitation of the sea using underwater habitats as base stations. In the end Cousteau repudiated such an approach, turning his efforts instead toward conservation. The lyrical and dramatic underwater sequences also likely contributed to the beginning of an era of ocean conservation as well as incidentally promoting sport diving. Memorable sequences involve men cavorting with fishes, an underwater chess game, and the diving saucer reaching depths of 300 meters, encountering new and unique forms of life.Reviews of the film were overwhelmingly positive, although the film did come under some criticism around accusations of \"faking\" footage, most notably by New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther who questioned the authenticity of two of the film\\'s more dramatic scenes. Crowther stated in his 1964 review, \"Oceanographers consulted here yesterday said it was highly unlikely that a deep-sea cavern, containing a \"bubble,\" or pocket of air, at its top, could exist. If it did, the atmosphere in that bubble would surely be noxious, they said. It would be methane or marsh gas. And the pressure in it would be intolerable for man.\"  [3]  The confusion came from Crowther\\'s assertion that the footage was filmed at great depth, an issue not clearly addressed in the film.  His other complaint was a long tracking shot moving out from the window of one of the underwater structures, which Crowther claimed could only have been produced in an aquarium.  Cousteau later demonstrated how he and his son Philippe produced the shot with a combination of ropes and small underwater motorized vehicles.  Cousteau took great offense and continued to describe and defend the difficult and innovative techniques used to create the film.',\n",
       " 'Voyage to the Edge of the World': \"In December 1972 The Cousteau Society sets out on a four-months expedition through Antarctica. The expedition is supported by Monaco's Oceanographic Museum and the La Rochelle Natural History Museum, the latter represented on board by Raymond Duguy (1927 - 2012), its director at the time.Divers and scientists of the expedition observe the fauna and the ice formations of the frozen continent. Footage is filmed on board the Calypso but also on land (for example at Deception Island), underwater, over sea ice or from the air, by means of a hot air balloon and a helicopter. Voyage to the Edge of the World was the first film to show underwater footage taken from the submerged inside of glaciers or icebergs. It also was the first film to show high depth footage in Antarctic waters (thanks to the diving saucer SP-350 Denise).Paleontologist Michel Laval, Calypso's Chief Mate, died on Deception Island, 29 December 1972, when he was struck by the tail propeller of the helicopter of the expedition.[1]\",\n",
       " 'The Deep (1977 film)': 'While scuba-diving near shipwrecks off Bermuda, vacationing couple David Sanders and Gail Berke recover a number of artifacts, including an ampoule of amber-coloured liquid and a medallion bearing the image of a woman and the letters \"S.C.O.P.N.\" (meaning \"Santa Clara, ora pro nobis\", for \"Saint Clara, pray for us\") and a date, 1714. Gail is attacked while probing a crevice in the wreck, and in panic escapes by getting loose from her wooden baton, which is shown to have its end shredded. Sanders and Berke seek the advice of lighthouse-keeper and treasure-hunter Romer Treece on the origin of the medallion; he identifies the item as Spanish and takes an interest in the young couple. The ampoule is noticed by the man who had rented diving equipment to Sanders and Berke, which in turn attracts the attention of Henri \"Cloche\" Bondurant, a local drug kingpin for whom the shop owner works, who unsuccessfully tries to buy the ampoule and then begins to terrorise the couple with black magic. The ampoule contains medicinal morphine from the Goliath, a ship that sank during World War II with a cargo of munitions and medical supplies. The wreck of the Goliath is considered dangerous and is posted as off-limits to divers due to the danger of explosions. Treece concludes that a recent storm has exposed her cargo of morphine and unearthed a much older wreck containing Spanish treasure.Treece makes a deal with Cloche, so they can dive in peace and making him believe he will get the ampoules for a million dollars, while his real plan is to have the chance to find the treasure. Cloche gives him three days to recover them. Sanders, Berke and Treece make several dives to the wrecks, recovering thousands of morphine ampoules from Goliath and several additional artifacts from the Spanish wreck. They also encounter a huge Moray eel, which lurks inside the vessel, and was obviously the source of the attack on Gail earlier. Adam Coffin, the only survivor from Goliath, joins to help in the boat, but his loyalty is not very clear. When they are attacked by sharks, Coffin only says that he probably fell asleep without noticing they were in trouble.Through research in Treece\\'s library, they reconstruct the history of the lost treasure ship, locate a list of valuable items, including a gold pinecone filled with pearls, with the letters \"EF\" engraved on it, and learn that it identifies Elisabeth Farnese, a noblewoman for whom they were made by the king of Spain. Sanders is determined to locate at least one item on the list to establish provenance, since without it there is no real value to the treasure. Treece wishes to destroy the Goliath to put the morphine out of reach of Cloche, and Cloche interferes with their efforts so that he can recover the morphine for himself. During a running series of conflicts, Treece\\'s friend Kevin is murdered by one of Cloche\\'s henchmen. Adam betrays them and is killed when he triggers a booby-trap while trying to steal the recovered morphine. A climactic battle during the final dive ensues, with Cloche (who is killed by the giant eel) and his divers being killed in the destruction of the Goliath and the recovery of a gold dragon necklace that will provide the needed provenance of the treasure.',\n",
       " 'The Big Blue': \"Two children, Jacques Mayol and Enzo Molinari, have grown up on the Greek island of Amorgos in the 1960s. Enzo challenges Jacques to collect a coin on the sea floor but Jacques refuses. Later, Jacques' father — who harvests shellfish from the seabed using a pump-supplied air hose and helmet — goes diving. His breathing apparatus and rope gets caught and punctured by rocks on the reef and weighed down by water, he drowns. Jacques and Enzo can do nothing but watch in horror as he is killed.By the 1980s, both are well known freedivers, swimmers who can remain underwater for great times and at great depths. Enzo is in Sicily now, where he rescues a trapped diver from a shipwreck. He is a world champion freediver with a brash and strong personality, and now wishes to find Jacques and persuade him to return to no limits freediving in order to prove he is still the better of the two, in a friendly sports rivalry. Jacques himself works extensively with scientific research as a human research subject, and with dolphins, and is temporarily participating in research into human physiology in the iced-over lakes of the Peruvian Andes, where his remarkable and dolphin-like bodily responses to cold water immersion are being recorded. Insurance broker Johana Baker visits the station for work purposes and is introduced to Jacques. She secretly falls in love with him. When she hears that Jacques will be at the World Diving Championships in Taormina, Sicily, she fabricates an insurance problem that requires her presence there, in order to meet him again. She and Jacques fall in love. However none of them realize the extent of Jacques' allurement with the depths. Jacques beats Enzo by 1 meter, and Enzo offers him a crystal dolphin as a gift, and a tape measure to show the small difference between Jacques' and Enzo's records. Johana goes back home to New York but is fired after her deception is discovered; she leaves New York and begins to live with Jacques. She hears the story that if one truly loves the deep sea, then a mermaid will appear at the depths of the sea, and will lead a diver to an enchanted place.At the next World Diving Championships, Enzo beats Jacques' record. The depths at which the divers are competing enter new territory and the dive doctor suggests they should cease competing, but the divers decide to continue. Jacques is asked to look at a local dolphinarium where a new dolphin has been placed, and where the dolphins are no longer performing; surmising that the new dolphin is homesick, the three of them break in at night to liberate the dolphin and transport her to the sea again. Back at the competition, other divers attempt to break Enzo's new record but all fail. Jacques then attempts his next dive and reaches 400\\xa0ft (122 m) breaking Enzo's world record. Angered by this, Enzo prepares to break Jacques' new world record. The doctor supervising the dive warns that the competitors must not go deeper - based upon Jacques' bodily reactions, at around 400\\xa0ft, conditions, and in particular the pressure, will become lethal and divers will be killed if they persist in attempting such depths. Enzo dismisses the advice and attempts the dive anyway, but is unable to make his way back to the surface. Jacques dives down to rescue him. Enzo, dying, tells Jacques that he was right and that it is better down there, and begs Jacques to help him back down to the depths, where he belongs. Jacques is grief-stricken and refuses, but after Enzo dies in his arms, finally honors his dying wish and takes Enzo's body back down to 400\\xa0ft, leaving him to drift to the ocean floor. Jacques - himself suffering from cardiac arrest after the dive - is rescued and brought back to the surface by supervising scuba divers and requires his heart to be restarted with a defibrillator before being placed in medical quarters to recover.Jacques appears to be recovering from the diving accident, but later experiences a strange hallucinatory dream in which the ceiling collapses and the room fills with water, and he finds himself in the ocean depths surrounded by dolphins. Johana, who has just discovered she is pregnant, returns to check up on Jacques in the middle of the night, but finds him lying awake yet unresponsive in his bed with bloody ears and a bloody nose. Johana attempts to help him, but Jacques begins to get up and walk to the empty diving boat and gets suited up for one final dive. Desperately, Johana begs Jacques not to go, saying she is alive but whatever has happened at the depths is not, but he says he has to. She tells Jacques that she is pregnant, and sorrowfully begs him to stay, but finally understands he feels he must go. The two embrace and Johana breaks down crying. Jacques then places the release cord for the dive ballast in her hand, and - still sobbing - she pulls it, sending him down to the depths he loves. Jacques descends and floats for a brief moment staring into the darkness. A dolphin then appears and - dreamlike - Jacques lets go of his harness and swims away with it into the darkness.The original ending was intentionally ambiguous,[citation needed] though considering the depth Jacques has swum to, it would seem he is unlikely to regain the surface alive, and he dies. In the American adaptation, the ending is extended with an additional scene: after swimming away with the dolphin, Jacques is returned to the surface.\",\n",

Daniel and Susan decide to separate briefly from the group while underwater. Half an hour later, the group returns to the boat; two members of the group are inadvertently counted twice, so the dive master thinks that everyone is back on board and the boat leaves the site. However, Daniel and Susan are still underwater, unaware that the others have returned to shore. When they resurface, the boat has gone. They believe that the group will soon return to recover them.Stranded at sea, it slowly dawns on Daniel and Susan that their boat is not coming back for them. They bicker, battle bouts of hunger and mental exhaustion and realize that they have probably drifted far from the dive site. They also realize that sharks have been circling them below the surface. Soon, jellyfish appear, stinging them both, while sharks come in close. Susan receives a small shark bite on the leg, but does not immediately realize it.

This request comes at the suggestion of Isolde \"Easy\" Mueller, the daughter of the owner of the lodge at Lake Wakapogee, and Abigail Page, the director of public relations for the lodge and Easy\\'s friend. They believe it would improve the tournament\\'s standing and Mr. Cadwalader\\'s business.Willoughby refuses to participate. After Abigail and Easy follow him around and speculate about the reasons, he confides the truth in them: He has never fished in his life, cannot stand the touch or taste of fish, cannot swim and cannot operate a boat.

On the third day, Willoughby, again by pure luck, catches another large fish, eventually winning the tournament. On that evening, Abigail comes to his lodge, in tears. She apologizes for getting him in so much trouble and also begs him to refuse the prize and come clean with his boss, the tournament director and his customers and competitors about not being able to fish. After she leaves, he admits that he was going to do that anyway but that she made it easier for him. He gathers everyone and confesses everything. Even though his boss fires him, everyone is impressed by his honesty. Willoughby then goes to look for Abigail, who went camping at the lake shore to be alone. He finds her but they bicker until a storm forces them to share her tent, where they fall asleep, still angry with each other. Meanwhile the competitors convince Cadwalader that he has to rehire Willoughby for business reasons: when it will come out that even a totally incompetent fisherman can win such a tournament with Cadwalader\\'s equipment, people will want to buy that equipment.

       " 'Ondine (film)': 'Syracuse \"Circus\" (Colin Farrell) is trawling with his fishing boat and finds a scantily clad young woman caught in his net. He sees she is alive and resuscitates her. She calls herself Ondine (Alicja Bachleda) and refuses to be taken to the hospital, not wanting to be seen by anyone else. He shelters her in a caravan house that belonged to his late mother in a quiet harbor, which makes him late for picking up his daughter Annie (Alison Barry), who uses a wheelchair and lives with his ex-wife Maura (Dervla Kirwan). During Annie\\'s dialysis, he tells her a story about a fisherman that catches a woman out of the sea. Annie explains the woman could be a magical selkie. Annie receives a new powerchair from the CRC, and upon returning home is greeted by Maura\\'s boyfriend Alex (Tony Curran). Maura flips Circus off for missing the doctor who had news on a kidney match for Annie.Next morning, Circus finds Ondine washing clothes in a stream, singing in an unknown language. She follows him on his boat to work the day. Circus pulls up only empty lobster pots, until Ondine starts singing, after which every pot contains a catch. Still not wanting to be seen, Ondine doesn\\'t follow Circus to the fish market where the lobsters are sold. Circus buys a dress and lies to the store clerk that it\\'s for Annie when she grows up.When Circus picks up Annie from her school, he continues the fisherman story by explaining how the woman sings to the fish for him to catch, a song in a language he has never heard before. Annie states that Selk is the language of the selkie. Circus stammers that his lobsters hear her sing, which makes Annie curious as to whose story this is, and she secretly follows him to the caravan. When Circus asks how long she will stay, Ondine says it is up to him. Humored, Circus answers forever and happily ever after, according to the fairytale he has been building with Annie, who watches them without being noticed. Annie is back home studying all her new library books on seals and selkies. Alex says selkies are Scottish creatures, but the one Annie saw is not.Circus meets with the priest (Stephen Rea) for a confession, who has repeatedly told Circus that this isn\\'t AA. Circus recalls a recurring nightmare where he is at Alex\\'s funeral and reunited with Maura, still with her drinking problem. As the priest pushes the subject away, Circus brings up the woman he pulled out of the water with his net and kept her. Ondine is by herself tidying up the caravan, and tries her new clothing as if the experience was a first, especially when she stretches leggings over one splayed hand so it looks webbed.The next day, Ondine is swimming and is met by an unexpected Annie, they bond together talking about selkies, none of which Ondine denies, kissing Annie goodbye before the child goes back to her mother. Circus is in the library asking for books about selkies, but discovers that Annie took them all. Annie runs into some neighbourhood kids showing off their bicycles, lets one of the kids play with her powerchair, it shorts out driving into water. The kids abandon \"spaz\" Annie, who is left alone to push it back home, where she finds Alex drinking beer. As Alex dries out the batteries, Annie asks again about selkies, he tells her they come from his homeland Outer Hebrides. However, Ondine doesn\\'t speak like him.Circus brings Ondine fishing again to steer the tiller, until a Fisheries board patrol boat zooms by, causing Ondine to hide. She begins singing again as he is pulling up his net, and finds it filled with a bountiful catch of salmon, that doesn\\'t come from trawling. Ondine hides as the patrol boat returns to inspect for prohibited gillnetting; the guards look for the truth by finding dry gillnets and Ondine hidden in them. Circus wasn\\'t sure if she could be seen, the guards accept Ondine\\'s answer as to how the fish were caught. Glad that Ondine isn\\'t invisible, Circus boats into the town harbor to sell their catch, where everyone stares at Ondine, including a dark-haired man who is looking for her. Circus and Ondine go shopping for clothes and run into Annie, who helps her with outfits, as townfolk gawk through the store window eyeing a very pretty Ondine.Later, Circus wants to pick up Annie for local regatta festivities. Maura says she already left. Ondine gets another surprise visit from Annie, and sees the caravan has been cleaned. Learning that Annie can\\'t swim, they both play in the shallow water, where Ondine finds something that Annie thinks is her seal coat, and they bury it in the greenhouse. Annie wants Ondine to stay for seven years, unless the selkie husband claims her back, and shares this with Circus as they all boat into town, Ondine warns Annie that she isn\\'t selk and can\\'t grant wishes. Upset, Annie pretends to have brake failure to throw herself off the pier, to test Ondine\\'s ability to breathe underwater, when Ondine jumps in to her rescue. They bring Annie back to Maura and Alex, who share with Annie that a man was asking for Ondine. This gives Annie a nightmare about the selkie husband coming. Back in the caravan, Circus explains he\\'s called Circus the Clown because he was an alcoholic like Maura. He stopped drinking for Annie, yet custody went to the mother.Back in the confessional, Circus tells the priest he sinned with Ondine the night before, and fears the good luck she brings, since he lost hope long ago. As he leaves, the unknown man approaches him about Ondine, Circus ignores him. Circus brings Annie back from dialysis, but is locked out since Maura and Alex are drinking in a pub. Annie asks to be left with them. Circus returns to find the caravan has been ransacked, and Ondine hiding nearby. Circus wants Ondine to stay and asks her to wish the man away, but her only wish is for Annie not to be sick. Ondine\\'s man is back in town driving with rage, causing an accident with Maura who was drunk driving. Alex is killed, thrown through the windshield. Ondine and Circus follow Annie to the hospital, and learn she is getting an immediate kidney transplant from Alex, who opted to be a donor. The man is also brought to the hospital, and asks Ondine why she speaks their language as they both don\\'t belong here.Circus and Maura both get drunk after Alex\\'s wake. Maura wants him to get rid of Ondine, now hiding in his boat, because of bad luck. Intoxicated Circus maroons Ondine at Roancarrig Lighthouse island because he thinks she will haunt him forever, as humans and selkies don\\'t belong together. Dusk comes and some driftwood gives Ondine\\'s basking silhouette the appearance of a seal\\'s tail, she jumps into the sea towards the seals on Seal Rock. The priest wakes up a depressed Circus, and he brings Annie from hospital to his home. She comforts him saying Ondine will be back because she left something behind. Annie watches TV with Sigur Rós performing, Circus recognizes they are the songs of Ondine, and goes back to find her on Seal Rock to demand the truth. Ondine gives one version that she is a sea creature that found her seal coat and buried it so she can stay with a family she loves. She then explains that she is a drug mule from Romania, and her pushta Vladic (Emil Hostina) was evading the Coast Guards, when she swam away with the backpack of heroin since Vladic can\\'t swim. She floated in the sea until Circus saved her.Circus brings Ondine back to Annie where they are ambushed by Vladic and another gunman, that Annie thinks want the seal coat. Everyone goes to the greenhouse to dig it up, but find nothing because Annie had moved it. Ondine promises to stay with Annie, revealing it was moved to a lobster pot. As they pull that up, Annie reminds Ondine that she is a selkie yet Vladic isn\\'t, Ondine trips Vladic overboard by pulling on the rope he is standing on. He drowns going after the falling lobster pot pushed back in by Annie. Circus throws the other Romanian into the water, disarming him and the Romanian is arrested ashore, along with Ondine, who faces deportation. Annie is seen making a confession to the priest who is to wed Circus and Ondine, completing the fairytale how selkie women often find unexpected happiness with a landsman.',\n",
       " 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen': 'Fisheries expert Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) receives an email from financial adviser Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt), seeking advice on a project to bring salmon fishing to the Yemen—a project being bankrolled by a wealthy Yemeni sheikh and supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (the FCO). Alfred dismisses the project as \"fundamentally unfeasible\" because the Yemen cannot provide the necessary environment for salmon. Meanwhile, the British Prime Minister\\'s press secretary, Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), suggests the salmon fishing story to the Prime Minister\\'s office as a positive story to help improve relations between Britain and the Islamic world.Alfred meets with Harriet to discuss the project, but despite Harriet correcting his misconceptions of the Yemen environment, Alfred is convinced that the project is foolhardy. Alfred\\'s boss, pressured by Patricia, forces Alfred to accept a position on the project. Alfred considers resigning rather than ruin his reputation in the scientific community, but is convinced by his wife that they need his income and pension.Harriet arranges for Alfred to meet the Sheikh (Amr Waked) at his estate in the Scottish Highlands. The Sheikh is excited to meet Alfred as he is the inventor of the \"Woolly Jones\" fishing fly.[7] While the Sheikh acknowledges that the project may sound crazy, he still believes that fishing is a noble pursuit that promotes harmony and requires immense faith.After his wife accepts a position in Geneva, Alfred devotes himself to the salmon project. Although painfully shy,[Note 1] he enjoys working with Harriet and they begin to make progress. Their enthusiasm is interrupted, however, when Harriet learns that her new boyfriend, British special forces Captain Robert Meyers (Tom Mison), is missing in action. Devastated, Harriet withdraws to her apartment. When Alfred visits her, she gets upset, thinking he just wants her to return to work, but then she realises he has come to comfort her, and the two embrace.Meanwhile, the Sheikh continues his work, despite radicals who accuse him of introducing Western ways to their region. Patricia informs the Sheikh that because of opposition to removing salmon from British rivers they will need to use farmed salmon. The Sheikh does not believe that salmon bred in captivity will survive and rejects Patricia\\'s offer, ending the British Government\\'s involvement in the project. Alfred resigns his government job to continue with the project.After a confrontation with his wife in which he realises that their marriage is over and that he is in love with Harriet, Alfred convinces the Sheikh to give the farmed salmon a try. As the two are fishing, a Yemeni radical attempts to assassinate the Sheikh, who is saved by Alfred casting his fishing line towards the assassin. Soon after, they return to the Yemen, where Harriet and Alfred continue to grow closer. After a moonlight swim, he asks her if there was a \"theoretical possibility\" of the two of them ending up together. She accepts with a kiss on his cheek, but says she will need some time.At a press conference in the Yemen, with the Foreign Secretary, Patricia reunites Harriet with her boyfriend Robert who has survived the counter-terrorism operation. The PR stunt leaves Alfred heartbroken. That night, Harriet realises her feelings for Robert have changed, and when Alfred gets a text message from his wife asking him to return, he declines.The following day the fish are released from their holding tanks. The fish swim upstream and everyone celebrates the success of the project. While Robert and the Foreign Secretary fly-fish for the photographers, terrorists break into the dam upstream and open the flood gates. Although most people survive the resulting flash flood, the valley is left in ruins. The Sheikh blames himself for the tragedy, and vows to rebuild—this time with the support of the local community.The next day, as Harriet prepares to leave with Robert, the latter says while she was the one thing on his mind that kept him alive during his mission, she doesn\\'t owe him anything. She approaches Alfred to say goodbye, where he tearfully wishes her luck as he ponders what to do next. Just then, they see a salmon jumping from the water, indicating that some fish survived. Alfred tells Harriet he will indeed stay and help them rebuild. Harriet asks if he will need a partner—and Alfred realises she is talking about herself. They embrace, and then hold hands while looking out over the river.',\n",

When they wake up, they find themselves hung up in a dog-food processing plant with the bookie and his henchman, Mooney in front of them.

With just one more pass, he could have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Sir\\xa0Ector\\'s armour to impersonate him, taking the prize.Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and help him train. While traveling, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge a patent of nobility so William can enter, assuming the name of \"Sir\\xa0Ulrich von Liechtenstein\" from Gelderland. But William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment.During the competition, William\\'s armor is badly damaged; he goads Kate, a female blacksmith, into repairing it without payment. He wins the tournament\\'s sword event, enabling him to pay Chaucer\\'s debt. In the joust, he faces Sir\\xa0Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honor of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar of Anjou, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn\\'s heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William. At the prize ceremony, William vows revenge on Adhemar, who then taunts William, \"You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.\"Kate joins William\\'s party and forges new lightweight armor. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir\\xa0Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Prince Edward. Unwilling to risk harming the future King of England, Adhemar immediately withdraws prior to their match. William, despite his friends\\' objections, chooses to joust against Edward anyway and then addresses him by name, further earning his respect.Adhemar is called away to the Battle of Poitiers, and William achieves several victories in his absence. William proves his love for Jocelyn by complying when she first asks him to deliberately lose (in contrast to knights who promise to win \"in her name\"), and then, just before he would be eliminated, to win the tournament after all.The group travels to London for the World Championship. William recalls leaving his father to squire for Sir\\xa0Ector and learn to become a knight, hoping to \"change his stars\". Adhemar has also arrived in London and announces that he is in negotiations with Jocelyn\\'s father for her hand in marriage. William dominates at the tournament, but when he visits and is seen patching his now-blind father\\'s leaky roof, Adhemar discovers his true identity and alerts the authorities.William is arrested and placed in the pillory, but is defended from the hostile crowd by his friends. Just as the mob reaches its frenzy, Prince Edward reveals himself. He acknowledges William\\'s honor and an ability to inspire his friends\\' dedication that is in the best traditions of knighthood. Edward then announces that William is in fact descended from an ancient noble family, and knights him \"Sir\\xa0William Thatcher\". He asserts that as Prince-royal, his declaration is \"beyond contestation\".William returns to the tournament to face Adhemar in the final match, but Adhemar cheats with an illegally sharpened lance, seriously injuring William. Entering the final pass, William is losing by two lances and must unhorse Adhemar to win. He demands to be stripped of his armor while Chaucer buys time by performing the introduction of William that he omitted earlier. William, unable to hold the lance due to his injuries, asks Wat to strap it to his arm. Finally, he tilts against Adhemar, with his father and Jocelyn in attendance. Bellowing his true name as he charges, he knocks Adhemar to the ground with a crushing blow. On the ground, Adhemar experiences a vision of William and his friends mockingly telling him that he has been \"weighed, measured, and found wanting\". With this final blow, William wins the world championship tournament. In the ensuing celebration, as Jocelyn and William embrace, Chaucer remarks that he should write an account of these events.',\n",

They are playing against Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Harpo Marx, and Charlie Chaplin (for which he is in his Tramp outfit). Actor Jack Holt, who is serving as referee, throws the ball, which begins the game. First out is Oliver, who is knocked off his horse when the two teams fight to get the ball from the other. He is hit on the head with horseshoes while on the ground. The Big Bad Wolf takes the ball and manages to keep it ahead of the others but Charlie Chaplin soon steals the ball and hits it into one of the poles, using his cane to turn himself around to go in the other direction and keep up with the team. Meanwhile, Ollie is struggling to get back on his horse because of his overweight body. As Mickey hits the ball toward his home goal, Harpo Marx and his ostrich are forced to duck under the sand to avoid being hit. Ollie is finally able to get onto his horse but his weight causes the horse's body to sag in the middle.In an attempt to make the horse stay up, Stan Laurel pulls Ollie's horse's tail out and ties it in a knot, which works. However, the horse refuses to get back in the game and no matter how hard Ollie tries to entice it, it stays in place. Stan tries to poke it with a needle to make it get going, but it takes off before he can do so, throwing Ollie off and having him get poked instead. In the game, the Big Bad Wolf takes the lead with the ball again, but loses his mallet in the process and uses his breath to make the ball go forward instead. However, Shirley Temple and The Three Little Pigs mock him for doing this and blow raspberries at him. He gets angry and pushes back by blowing the fence they are behind away and clouding them with dust, but the distraction causes him to lose his lead in the game. Donald Duck takes the lead and hits the ball, but Harpo Marx hits the ball back at him and the momentum behind the two to get the ball ends with them colliding.Donald yells insults at him for knocking him off, but Harpo responds by punching him with boxers' mitts that he hides in his clothes, burns Donald with a blowtorch and uses a noisemaker to push him away, back to his donkey. The ball lands right next to him and he tries to hit it but the team takes it away. Frustrated, he tries to get his donkey to move but it sits on him, laughing. It then kicks him into the ground where the ball lands on his tail and he is trampled by the other players (including Ollie, who finally manages to get back in the game). Donald throws a tantrum and accidentally swallows the ball, causing the teams to chase after him to get it out. Harpo hits him first, using the head of his ostrich, and the Big Bad Wolf manages to briefly get the ball out by hitting him but it bounces back inside Donald. All of the players from both teams try to hit him which eventually causes him to dig into the sand to escape. Donald tries to hide inside a pole but the teams continue to try to hit him out. Finally, he rips the pole off its base and leads both teams toward referee Jack Holt, which causes everyone to collide and make the horses end up riding their owners and continue the game in that way.\",\n",

Believing she needs some excitement in her life, Mary\\'s free-spirited Uncle Hannibal (Harry Davenport) takes her dancing at a nightclub, which the police raid for gambling. When Horace learns that press reporters have discovered Mary\\'s name on the police report, he sends his daughter off to the family\\'s Palm Beach, Florida mansion.For Mary, Palm Beach during the off season is a place of loneliness and boredom. She asks her two housemaids (Patsy Kelly and Mabel Todd) if she can go along with them on a blind date with some cowboys from a visiting rodeo. The two maids reluctantly agree. Feeling sorry for the inexperienced Mary, they coach her on their three-step \"system\" for getting a man interested: flatter him, get him talking about himself, and play on his sympathy with a hard-luck story.After the rodeo, the three women meet up with their dates at the Rodeo Cafeteria and pair off. Mary is immediately attracted to the tall, lanky, and unpretentious cowboy Stretch Willoughby (Gary Cooper) and arranges to be with him. After dinner, they continue their evening back at Mary\\'s beachfront estate. Aware that the plain-spoken Stretch is suspicious of high society rich folk, Mary pretends to be a lady\\'s maid whose \"boss\" is out of town. Mary attempts to get the shy cowboy interested by following the first two steps of the \"system\" but fails to attract his interest. Determined, she proceeds to the third step, inventing a hard-luck story about her drunken father and four younger sisters whom she alone must support. When she adds a tear or two to embellish her story, Stretch is won over, and the evening ends with the two kissing in the moonlight.The next morning, an enamoured Stretch appears at the mansion prepared to ask for Mary\\'s hand in marriage. Unprepared for this turn of events, Mary casually dismisses his awkward proposal. Angered at the rejection, Stretch tosses Mary into the swimming pool and storms off. Completely fascinated by this man who is unlike any other she\\'s met, Mary follows Stretch when he boards a ship for Galveston. Determined to apologize, Mary finally succeeds in getting the stubborn cowboy to listen to her, but she is unable to reveal her true identity.

Mary does her best to adapt to the dusty and primitive conditions, but she is having a difficult time. Stretch senses Mary\\'s unease, but believes it stems from her worrying over her \"family\"—the fictitious drunken father and four younger sisters she\\'s supporting. He suggests she return to Palm Beach alone to settle her family obligations. Although she is ashamed of her continued deception, Mary fears Stretch will reject her if he learns the truth about her wealthy family. Stretch believes he\\'s married a \"work horse\" who works hard to support her family, not a \"show horse\" like her fictitious boss. Confused and miserable, Mary agrees to go back home for a few days and later meet up with Stretch at his ranch in Montana.Back at her Palm Beach mansion, Mary learns that her father is on his way with all his committee members, plus an important congressman who holds the presidential nomination in his power. Her sympathetic Uncle Hannibal arrives early, and Mary tearfully confides her secret marriage to him. When Mary\\'s father arrives, he assumes his daughter will serve as dutiful hostess and support his political plans.

When asked for his opinion about Mary\\'s father\\'s running for president, Stretch condemns the whole group for their behavior and leaves in anger. Seeing his daughter\\'s distress, Horace realizes that he has not been a good father, and comforts Mary as they listen to the whistle of the train that is taking her husband out of her life.Back in Montana, a subdued Stretch arrives home only to find his father-in-law sitting on his front porch, wanting to chat about farming. Horace tells Stretch that he has quit the presidential race because he now knows that Mary\\'s happiness is more important, acknowledging that Mary made sacrifices all her life, thinking only of her father, never herself. Upon entering the ranchhouse, the bewildered Stretch finds a party underway, Uncle Hannibal raiding the kitchen, and Mary herself baking a cake with Ma Hawkins. Soon after, the cowboy and the lady are seen kissing in Ma Hawkins\\' kitchen.[1][3][4]',\n",

Goodman attempts to seduce attorney Katherine \"Kate\" Veatch, who is handling his account; repulsed, she cites conflict of interest (COI) to rebuff his disturbing advances, telling him she does not date clients.Peter, gym employees Dwight Baumgarten and Owen Dittman and members Steve \"Pirate\" Cowan, Justin Redman, and Gordon Pibb all band together to raise the required money. After a car wash suggested by Owen fails, Gordon suggests entering a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas with a $50,000 prize. After the team watches a 1950s-era training video obtained by Justin featuring Irish-American dodgeball legend Patches O\\'Houlihan, Girl Scout Troop 417 easily defeats them in a local qualifying match, but are disqualified due to one member\\'s use of three separate types of anabolic steroids and a low-grade beaver tranquilizer, effectively handing the win to Average Joe\\'s by default.Having spied on Average Joe\\'s using a hidden camera in a cardboard cutout of himself, Goodman forms his own team, the Globo Gym Purple Cobras, and introduces them, revealing that his friendship with the chancellor enabled him to join the tournament. After watching their confrontation, the aging Patches, now a wheelchair user, approaches Peter, volunteering to coach the team. Patches\\'s unusual training regimen includes throwing wrenches at the team, forcing them to dodge oncoming cars, and constantly insulting them. Kate demonstrates skill at the sport but declines to join the team, citing COI. Goodman shows up at Kate\\'s house uninvited and announces that he lied to her bosses that she was drinking on the job, thus getting her fired from her law firm so that he can date her.

Inspired by Patches\\' spirit, Peter blindfolds himself, successfully dodges Goodman\\'s throw and strikes him in the face, winning the championship and the prize money. Goodman nullifies the victory, revealing that Peter sold Average Joe\\'s to him the previous night, but Peter surprisingly reveals that he used Goodman\\'s $100,000 to bet on Average Joe\\'s to win; with the odds against them at 50 to 1, he collects $5 million. Since Globo Gym is a publicly traded company, as Kate explains, Peter purchases a controlling interest in it, thus regaining Average Joe\\'s, then publicly fires Goodman. Steve, now with a more normal appearance, returns and apologizes to Peter, but revives his pirate persona when Peter shows him their winnings.

He is a \"gunter\" (an egg hunter) who spends all his spare time researching films, songs, TV series, and videogames from the 1980s and \\'90s to aid his hunt. The hunt has been going on for five years, yet no one has been able to find the first key (the Copper Key). Then Wade, who goes by the avatar name Parzival, stumbles upon the possibility that the first clue (known for containing a Dungeons & Dragons reference) refers to the virtual school planet Ludus (on which he is stuck) and after defeating an NPC character at Joust, is given the Copper Key which unlocks the First Gate, and a clue about where to find it and how to access it (by beating the video game Dungeons of Daggorath in a recreation of Halliday\\'s own bedroom). This places him in a simulation of the film WarGames in which he has to recreate the lines of the lead character. After clearing the Gate, he is awarded points and his avatar\\'s name appears on the previously empty scoreboard.

He takes advantage of his fame, endorsing virtual products for credits, and develops a tentative relationship with Art3mis. He is approached by Nolan Sorrento, an executive from Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who want to control the OASIS. Sorrento offers Wade a lucrative job to help IOI finish the hunt, but after Wade refuses, they attempt to assassinate him.The hunt for the egg continues, with two Japanese hunters named Daito and Shoto gaining points. However, after Wade asks Art3mis out on a date at the Distracted Globe virtual nightclub on planet Neonoir and admits his love for her, Art3mis cuts him off and stops speaking to him, leading to Wade becoming increasingly isolated.

       " 'Rollerball (1975 film)': 'In 2018, Jonathan E. is the team captain and veteran star of the Houston Rollerball team. He has become the sport\\'s most recognizable and talented player. After another impressive performance against Madrid, Mr. Bartholomew, chairman of the Energy Corporation, whose headquarters is Houston, announces that Jonathan will be featured in a \"multivision\" broadcast about his career.Bartholomew tells Jonathan that he wants him to retire. He offers the Rollerballer a lavish retirement package if Jonathan makes the announcement during the special. He then preaches the benefits of corporate-run society and the importance of respecting executive decisions, never explaining exactly why he must retire. Jonathan refuses, and requests to see his former wife Ella, who had been taken from him some years earlier by a corporate executive who wanted her for himself.Suspicious of a forced retirement, Jonathan goes to a library and asks for books about the corporations and history. He finds that all books have been digitized and \"edited\" to suit the corporations, and are now stored on supercomputers at large protected corporate locations. Cletus, Houston\\'s former coach who brought Jonathan along and helped make him a superstar, is now an Energy executive as well as Jonathan\\'s friend. He warns him that the Executive Committee is afraid of him, though he cannot learn why people so powerful would be afraid of a Rollerballer, even the best player in the world.Rollerball soon degrades into senseless violence as the rules are changed just to force Jonathan out. Houston\\'s semi-final game against Tokyo has no penalties and only limited substitutions. The brutality of the match kills several players, including Houston\\'s lead biker, Blue. Jonathan\\'s best friend and teammate, Moonpie, is targeted by three Tokyo skaters and rendered unconscious. Despite the violence, Houston is victorious and will play New York for the world championship.After the game, Jonathan is brought to a Tokyo hospital, where it is revealed Moonpie has been left in an irreversible coma by his injuries. Jonathan defies a doctor pressuring him to sign a release form to remove his teammate\\'s life support and has Moonpie brought to Houston to receive further medical care. Bartholomew hosts an executive teleconference to discuss the game\\'s future. They decide that the Houston – New York game will be played with no penalties, no substitutions, and no time limit in the hope that Jonathan, if he decides to play, will be killed during the game. The conference reveals why Jonathan must retire: Rollerball was conceived not only to satisfy man\\'s bloodlust, but to demonstrate the futility of individualism. Jonathan\\'s popularity and longevity as a player threaten this purpose.Jonathan makes his way to Geneva to access the world\\'s central supercomputer, known as Zero. While revered as the repository of all human knowledge, Zero\\'s memory is corrupted, which is revealed when the librarian mentions that Zero has \"lost\" or misplaced the entire 13th Century, wiping out for all time consequential literature including Dante\\'s Inferno.  Zero, \"finds things, and loses them, and confuses itself.\" Jonathan\\'s goal is to find out how the corporations make their decisions. Instead of finding an explanation, he encounters doubletalk and psychobabble from Zero, exposing the fragility, imperfections, and impermanence of volatile memory, electronic records, and digitized encyclopedic knowledge.[13]Afterwards, Jonathan receives a visit from his former wife Ella, who has been sent to convince him to retire and to make it clear that the coming game will be \"to the death.\" Jonathan realizes his wife\\'s visit was set up by the Executives, and erases a long-cherished movie of the two of them, stating, \"I just wanted you on my side.\" Jonathan decides that despite the dangers, he will play.The final match quickly loses any semblance of order that it might have had as the players are injured or killed. The crowd, ecstatic at first, gradually becomes subdued as the carnage unfolds before them and the game devolves into a gladiatorial fight. Jonathan is soon the only player left on the track for Houston, while a skater and a bikeman remain from New York. After a violent struggle in front of Mr. Bartholomew\\'s box, Jonathan dispatches the skater and takes the ball from him. The biker charges but Jonathan counters, knocking him off his bike and down to the inside of the track. He pins the biker down and raises the ball over his head, then pauses. Refusing to kill his fallen opponent, Jonathan gets to his feet and painfully makes his way to the goal, slamming the ball home and scoring the game\\'s only point.Jonathan skates around the track in silent victory. The coaches and fans of both teams chant his name, first softly, then louder and louder as he skates faster and faster. Mr. Bartholomew exits the arena hurriedly, possibly fearing a riot as the chant of \"Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!\" becomes a roar.',\n",

They find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting a basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a La-Z-Boy chair. Their friend, Kenny \"Squeak\" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.Businessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that \"anyone can be a sports hero\". Coop is reluctant, but ultimately accepts the opportunity.Five years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer\\'s team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow\\'s will names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow\\'s widow Yvette. Coop and Remer then meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and a passionate fan of BASEketball; Coop, Remer and Squeak begin spending time with the two, with Coop eventually forming a relationship with Jenna. Baxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow\\'s rules preventing monetization of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team; however, the Beers still continue winning games and heading towards the championship. Cain approaches Remer, telling him that he made an offer to Coop, but Coop refused without telling Remer. Remer confronts Coop about what Cain told him, and Coop quickly compromises by declaring Remer part owner of the team.Later, Cain cuts the funding to Jenna\\'s foundation in an attempt to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes conceited with his newfound A-list status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through child labor in Calcutta; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna\\'s foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop, as Coop and Remer blame each other for the controversy.With their friendship dissolved, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop and Remer still argue with each other and the Beers are losing; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16–0. Having had enough of Coop and Remer\\'s feuding, Squeak gives the stadium an impassioned speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else\\'s lives, and what they risk losing. Motivated, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette, also moved by Squeak\\'s speech, breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop\\'s La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is crestfallen until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a Barcalounger. After a risky last throw, they win the Denslow Cup. Jenna and Coop reconcile as Yvette makes out with Remer and the both of them skate around the stadium with their new trophy.',\n",

Years later, a now-adult Jim arrives on the campus of Carlisle School to continue his education. He likes his roommates at the boarding school well enough, fast-talking Ed Guyac and the huge Little Boy Who Walk Like Bear, but nearly gets into a fight with upperclassman and football star Peter Allendine.When the academic pressure becomes too much for him, Jim goes for a long run, during which he outraces some practicing track athletes.

Sunset Shimmer, who has been observing her friends\\' magical ability to \"pony up\" – grow pony-like ears, tails, and wings – whenever they play musical instruments, becomes concerned when Rainbow Dash transforms during a pep rally, seemingly at random. Tasked with finding the cause of this development, Sunset attempts to contact Twilight for advice, but receives no response.Meanwhile, one of Crystal Prep\\'s students, Twilight\\'s human counterpart, investigates the magical activity surrounding Canterlot High. Twilight builds a locket-like device with which to detect and contain the magic for further study, hoping this will secure her application for Everton, a coveted independent study program. However, Principal Cinch threatens to revoke the application to blackmail Twilight into participating in the Friendship Games and maintain Crystal Prep\\'s victory record.Upon Twilight\\'s arrival at Canterlot High, her device detects Sunset and her friends\\' magic and leads Twilight to them; as she approaches, the device inadvertently drains Rarity\\'s magic when she \"ponies up\" after making uniforms for her friends. Sunset, initially mistaking Twilight for her pony counterpart, quickly realizes the misunderstanding and considers consulting Twilight in person. When Crystal Prep\\'s Twilight follows her to the portal to Equestria, the device absorbs the portal\\'s magic and seals it off.

The magic instead corrupts Twilight, turning her into a winged monster[N 3] who proceeds to destroy the statue portal and open more rifts that threaten to destroy the parallel world. As the Wondercolts and Shadowbolts work together to save their classmates, Sunset notices her friends\\' magical auras and realizes that their magic manifests when they exhibit the same traits as the Elements of Harmony. Gathering their magic with the device, Sunset assumes an angelic form resembling Princess Celestia,[N 4] closes the rifts, and returns Twilight to normal.Refusing to relent for manipulating Twilight, Cinch threatens to report the incident to the school board. When taunted that no one would believe her account of the magical incidents, however, she concedes to a tie that is celebrated by both teams. Reconsidering her Everton application, Twilight realizes she is happier at Canterlot High and transfers there, where Sunset and the other students welcome her as a new friend.In a pre-credits scene, the Twilight from Equestria emerges from the portal with the counterparts of her friends gathered around it. She apologizes for her absence, explaining that she has just escaped from a time travel loop, before gawking at the sight of her own counterpart.',\n",

He attends a briefing on a skyscraper heist, in which the criminals stole diamonds, escaping by parachute, in Mumbai. A similar heist happens over Mexico where the criminals unload millions of dollars in bills, then disappear into the Cave of Swallows. Utah\\'s research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they\\'ll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah is sent undercover to France under a field agent named Pappas (Ray Winstone).

Chowder slips and falls to his death, and Utah becomes depressed about it.After a party, Samsara explains that she and Bodhi both knew Ono Ozaki when they were young, that her parents died in an avalanche accident and Ozaki gave her a home after. She explains further that Ozaki actually completed his third ordeal, despite what was widely believed. He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a whaling ship crashing into his boat while he was trying to save humpback whales. On his boat, a young boy, Bodhi, decided not to tell the truth of his story but to finish what Ozaki started.Next they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. Bodhi escapes because Utah cannot stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi\\'s sponsors\\' assets; Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them to death, who is revealed to be Samsara and not Bodhi.Utah finds the location of the next ordeal: free solo climbing with no safety beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, killing him.

After Geordie comes out last in the opening parade of athletes in his kilt, Pauceton receives a telegram emphatically ordering him not to let Geordie wear his kilt, but he ignores it.During the competition, a listless, dispirited Geordie fails with his first two throws. Then, before his third and final throw, he finds inspiration by recalling Jean\\'s encouragement at his first competition. He then makes a world record throw and wins the competition. However, Jean hears on the radio that Helga has rushed up, embracing and kissing Geordie in front of everyone in the stadium, and she is heartbroken.On Geordie\\'s return, there is no one to meet him at the station apart from his mother and a driver for the trap.

       " 'Animalympics': 'The film is a series of vignettes presented as the broadcast of the first animal Olympic Games through the fictional ZOO television network. The Games combine summer and winter Olympic events.The event is covered mostly by Barbara Warblers, a stork, and \"anchorturtle\" Henry Hummel. The 100-meter dash is covered in the style of a drag race by Jackie Fuelit.Unlike the real Olympics, continents are represented rather than countries. The continents featured are North America, South America, Eurasia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Eurasia represents the USSR, whereas Europe represents Western and Central Europe.The only mention of areas other than continents are the New York City Rats soccer team, Dean Wilson being from California, a Central American marathon runner named Pepé Repanosa, an Acapulco cliff diver named \"Primo Cabeza\", marathon runner Terry Hornsby being from Boulder, Colorado, René Fromage being from France, and Kurt Wüfner appearing at the downhill event right before a Scandinavian is given a gold medal.Although many of the segments stand alone, there are some recurring events and important characters. The largest such story is the coverage of the marathon, where competitors René Fromage and Kit Mambo are the favorites to win. Both are determined to win – Fromage having devoted his entire life to the marathon, Mambo determined to make a name for herself – they find themselves surprised when their minds wander to thoughts of mutual admiration and then to love, culminating in the pair holding hands for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line together.  Another important story is that of Kurt Wüffner, a West German dachshund skier, and his disappearance to Dogra-la during a mountain climbing expedition shortly after the slalom event.A minor story features an alligator named Bolt Jenkins. He was \"born as a handbag\" and told he would never walk again. A song during his story reveals that he lives in the sewers.

       " 'The First Olympics: Athens 1896': 'The preparation and events leading up to the inaugural modern Olympic Games held in Athens, 1896. The movie examines the experience of competitors from different nations, but especially concentrates on the creation of the first American Olympic team and their trials in getting to the Olympics in Athens.',\n",
       " 'Dorf and the First Games of Mount Olympus': 'Set in A.D. 1 during the days of the Roman Empire, Emperor Dorf announces the first Olympic Games as a way to promote peace between the nations.Each competition either includes only Dorf as a competitor, or Dorf sparring with Leonard: shot put, fencing, discus, pole vault, relay race, javelin, weightlifting, hurdles, balance beam, hammer throw and boxing. In the end, Dorf, as emperor, is awarded first prize despite losing most of the head-to-head matches to Leonard. The prize is a massive millstone, which causes Dorf to tumble off the podium when it is placed on his neck.',\n",
       " 'Fire, Ice and Dynamite': 'The plot functions primarily as link between the stunt action scenes which mainly deal with skiing like in Fire and Ice. It also contains heavy product placement (for example, VW released a special edition of the Golf MK II named \"Fire & Ice\" which featured some special equipment details like the seat covers being said to be designed by Bogner himself).Roger Moore plays an entrepreneur who is in debt with many companies. After faking his death by apparent suicide by jumping out of a plane, his children and several companies participate in several sporting events (skiing, rafting, bobsled etc.) for his $135 million estate - winner takes all. Additionally, a family of villains tries to get to the money.',\n",
       " 'Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)': 'Astérix and Obélix must win the Olympic Games in order to help their friend Lovesix marry Princess Irina. Brutus uses every trick in the book to have his own team win the game and get rid of his father Julius Caesar in the process.The film is loosely adapted from the original Asterix at the Olympic Games comic book. The love story subplot between Lovesick and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in Asterix comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book.'}"
